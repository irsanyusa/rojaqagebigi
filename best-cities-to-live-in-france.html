While some jobs do require living in the “City of Lights”, there are many other options across the country to consider. Here is our list of the best cities in France to live in for quality of life, family friendliness, great weather, incredible food, and more.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Cities in France to live in for expats</h2><p>France scores fairly well in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">InterNations Quality of Life Index for Expats</a>, hitting number 18 in their 2019 survey. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris</a> looms large in the international imagination, it’s definitely not the only option when it comes to the best cities to live and work in. Whether it’s a sunny climate or a historic old town you crave, there are options across the country.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Toulouse:-Best-for-families>Toulouse: Best for families</h3><p>This southern French city is the centre of the French aerospace industry, with big <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">international employers</a> like Airbus and Intel headquartered here. Correspondingly, there are good options for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">international schools and bilingual schools</a>, and lots of expat families to connect with. The city is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth largest</a> in France, and is nicknamed La ville rose (the pink city) as so many of its buildings are constructed using pale-coloured bricks. There’s the added benefit of the warmer climate, and the ability to visit Italy or Spain with a short journey by car or train.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Lyon:-Best-for-foodies>Lyon: Best for foodies</h3><p>This whole city is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it features on many “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best cities in France to live in</a>” lists for good reason: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Great food</a>, incredible wine, and loads of culture and history. This central French city is in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alps region in the southeast, and you’ll be able to easily nip over to Switzerland or Italy for a weekend away. You’re right on the edge of the Beaujolais wine region, and in the hometown of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Bocuse</a>, one of the most famous French chefs in the world.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Strasbourg:-Best-for-travel>Strasbourg: Best for travel</h3><p>Strasbourg embodies both the spirit of France and Germany, having historically been a part of each country several times. Now, it serves one of the centres of European administration as the seat of the European Parliament, as well as many other related organisations. That translates to a city with many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">international school options</a>. In Strasbourg, you’re near the centre of western Europe and the city is also a major train travel hub, so there’s lots to explore. The German Black Forest is a short train or car journey away, and Switzerland and Italy only a bit further afield. The famous vineyards of Alsace are on your doorstep as well.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Montpellier:-Best-for-nightlife>Montpellier: Best for nightlife</h3><p>Another city in the south, Montpellier benefits from the warm and sunny Mediterranean climate and its seaside location. If you’re looking for a fun city that’s cheaper than Paris, this might be your best bet – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every second resident in Montpellier is under 30 years old</a>. It’s also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more affordable</a> than the famous cities further along the coast like Nice and Cannes. It does get very hot in the summer however, regularly hitting 40ºC, but thankfully the seaside is nearby. You’re close to Spain for easy holidays by car or train, or try the ferries to Corsica and Sardinia.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Rennes:-Best-for-budget-living>Rennes: Best for budget living</h3><p>This small city in Brittany won <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Local France’s poll</a> for the best city in France to live for expats. Brittany is a favourite for its seaside villages and relatively <a href=#>cheap cost of living</a> and housing. Lots of fresh seafood, a vibrant student community, and a beautiful old city centre make Rennes a pleasant place to settle down. It’s a favourite with Brits living abroad, with a large expat community. One downside is that the weather can be rainy, and it doesn’t get very hot in the summer. However, the seaside villages are frequently voted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">village preféré des Français (the best village in France)</a> by a national TV station, so your weekend trips will definitely be Instagram worthy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Paris:-Best-for-culture>Paris: Best for culture</h3><p>It’s impossible to make a list of the top cities in France to live in without including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris</a>. Yes, it’s expensive, busy, and a bit overwhelming at times, but you’re also in one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cultural capitals</a> of the world. Being able to take in world-famous landmarks on a February morning when no one is around is a special thrill reserved for those of us who have chosen to make a life abroad. Many job opportunities for English speakers will be based in Paris, and there are also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several international school options</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Grenoble:-Best-for-digital-nomads>Grenoble: Best for digital nomads</h3><p>Grenoble is a great city to live and work in because it is affordable, vibrant, and surrounded by nature making it a great option for budget-minded people as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">digital nomads</a>. Grenoble also has a diverse cultural scene, with museums, theaters, and universities. The city is surrounded by mountains and therefore a great place for hiking, biking, and other outdoor activities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>New city? New language level!</h2><p>So now you have a list of cities worth considering when moving to France off the beaten path of Paris. No matter where you move to, living in France is much easier when your French language skills improve. No time for in-person class? Lingoda has you covered with their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online classes</a> led by trained, native-level teachers on a flexible schedule.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erin-2-2.jpeg><h2>Erin McGann</h2><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
