Sunak hyped the deal, which grants major concessions to the European Union, by describing his excitement over Northern Ireland’s “unique” position in having access to both European and British markets — exactly what all British voters once enjoyed, his opponents<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> quickly pointed out</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The deal seems to have done much to galvanize faith in Sunak’s leadership among his base at the least, which puts him in a better position to shape policy and messaging leading up to elections that must be held by January 2025. However, polls of a hypothetical matchup still show Labour with <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>a dominant lead</a>, and time is not on Sunak’s side as he attempts to set the Tories back on track.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOrKynmZtirrG80aitmqRdp661tc2gZKenoqm1pr7NZqCrnZyWu6V506uYnZ1dmbKiuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dechets-menagers-la-concertation-fer-de-lance-dune-bonne-gestion.html><span>←</span><span>la concertation, fer de lance d'une bonne gestion</span></a>
