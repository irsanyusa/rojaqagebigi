<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Benefits of grapefruit sexually | Pulse Nigeria</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Grapefruit is one delicious fruit that falls into this category. This citrus fruit can be white, yellow, pink or red in colour. It is low in calories, high in nutrients and can transform your sexual life.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>Sexual benefits of grapefruit for men</h2></p><p>If you are looking for a way to spice up your life sexually as a man, here are ways in which grapefruit can help;</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>1. Increases testosterone levels</h3></p><p>A man who eats grapefruit stands a good chance of increasing their testosterone levels. This is because this citrus fruit contains a compound called Naringenin which is a type of antioxidant that can help increase testosterone levels in men. When your testosterone is boosted, you get to enjoy improved libido and sexual performance.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>2. Enhances blood flow</h3></p><p>It is common knowledge that sex has to do with lots of blood flow. The antioxidants in grapefruit help in increasing sexual performance as they help to promote healthy blood circulation, which is crucial for achieving and maintaining erections. Improved blood flow can contribute to better sexual function.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>3. Great for prostate health</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Another way grapefruit helps to increase sexual performance for men is that it is beneficial for the prostate. The prostate gland, located near the bladder and urethra, produces seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm during ejaculation.</p><p>A healthy prostate ensures proper semen production and ejaculation, contributing to fertility and reproductive health. Grapefruit contains lycopene which is beneficial for prostate health. This means the more grapefruit you consume, the better your overall sexual health as a man.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2b31608f-130d-4fb9-9339-e95e7a741980 data-caption="Grapefruit offers sexual benefits to both men and women [Wikipedia]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/jCjktkpTURBXy9jYWJkODlkMmZiMzMzYjI2NDdjOWU5NTYxYjUwZjViZi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Sexual benefits of grapefruit for women</h2></p><p>Grapefruit possesses sexual benefits for women too. Here are some ways women can benefit from grapefruit sexually;</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>4. Balances hormones</h3></p><p>Grapefruit contains phytoestrogens and this is quite beneficial for ladies. Phytoestrogens are similar to estrogen, the primary female sex hormone. When consumed, these phytoestrogens can exert mild estrogenic effects in women, contributing to hormone balance.</p><p>Many ladies suffer from hormonal imbalances with effects such as low estrogen levels or fluctuations during menopause which can then lead to symptoms like decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and mood swings, which can impact sexual satisfaction. Consumption of grapefruit however helps to alleviate these symptoms that may affect libido and sexual satisfaction.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>5. Increases lubrication</h3></p><p>Grapefruit contains hydration properties which can contribute to increased vaginal lubrication. This means eating grapefruit can increase comfort and pleasure during sexual activity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>6. Boosts mood</h3></p><p>It is also believed that the aroma of grapefruit has some sort of uplifting effect on your mood. A positive mood can lead to heightened sexual desire and enjoyment.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>General benefits of grapefruit</h2></p><p>Aside from its sexual benefits, here are some other health benefits of consuming grapefruit;</p><ul class=list><li><strong>Good source of vitamin C</strong></li></ul><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Grapefruit is a powerhouse of vitamin C, which supports the immune system and overall vitality. A healthy body is more likely to experience satisfying sexual experiences.</p><ul class=list><li><strong>Low in calories</strong></li></ul><p>If you are looking to lose weight, grapefruit should be your go-to fruit as it is low in calories and high in water content, making it a filling and hydrating snack that can help control hunger and reduce overall calorie intake. Also, grapefruit is rich in fibre, which promotes satiety, aids in digestion, and supports a healthy gut microbiome, all of which are important for weight management.</p><ul class=list><li><strong>Antioxidant properties</strong></li></ul><p>Grapefruit is also rich in antioxidants, which are compounds that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and various health problems, including chronic diseases.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The antioxidants found in grapefruit, such as vitamin C, beta-carotene, flavonoids, and polyphenols, work together to neutralise free radicals, reduce oxidative stress, and support overall health. Antioxidants also play a role in skin health, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being, making grapefruit a valuable addition to a balanced and nutritious diet.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-31>Conclusion</h3></p><p>Grapefruit offers a range of sexual benefits for both men and women, thanks to its nutritional content and unique properties.
