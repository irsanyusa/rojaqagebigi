According to the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a>, it’s a big trend among high-end restaurants to now require a credit card to hold a reservation, much like hotels require a credit card to guarantee a room booking. And, in the same way that hotels charge customers if they don’t show up and fail to cancel their reservations, many restaurants now hit no-shows with fees. In January, for instance, <a href=#>Eleven Madison</a> (in Manhattan, of course) started charging $75 per head for parties who make reservations but don’t show up, and don’t cancel at least 48 hours in advance. Another Manhattan fine-dining establishment, <a href=#>Torrisi Italian Specialties</a>, offers a tasting menu for $125 per person—and charges the full $125 for each no-show who hasn’t canceled 24 or more hours ahead of time.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>McDonald’s Dollar Menu Shakeup: No More Fries and Drinks for $1</a>)</p><p>The reservation service <a href=#>OpenTable</a> says that 10% of restaurants around the country now require credit cards for reservations, and 15% of New York City restaurants do so. It’s not clear, though, what portion of these restaurants actually charges diners who reserve but fail to show.</p><p>Restaurants are taking action against no-shows because empty tables represent lost revenues. Also, the rise of online reservation services such as OpenTable seems to have brought with them an increase in no-shows. Many customers flippantly reserve online and don’t think twice about failing to show up. Apparently, reserving via the Web isn’t taken as seriously as reservations made by phone.</p><p>Besides charging no-shows, some restaurants are also trying to shame them—or perhaps just vent a little. In the same way that diners who’ve had a lousy meal or awful service will immediately post their thoughts on Twitter, Facebook, TripAdvisor, or Yelp, some restaurant staff are turning to social media to out no-show diners. At other restaurants, managers will call up customers and ask for an explanation about why they were no-shows.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Look Out Dunkin’ Donuts: McDonald’s Offers Breakfast Pastries</a>)</p><p>While a penalty for no-shows is primarily a phenomenon at high-end restaurants (I haven’t heard of this happening at the Friendly’s my kids are always begging me to take them to), it’s not limited strictly to swanky big-city establishments. Last fall, <a href=#>Walt Disney World changed its reservation policy</a>, making credit cards a requirement in many cases. Now, at two dozen restaurants within the central Florida resort, no-shows who reserve and haven’t canceled at least a day in advance will be charged $10 to $25 per head.</p><p>No word on whether Mickey, Donald, Goofy, or any of the princesses will also Tweet bad things about the rude customers who didn’t cancel their reservations on time.</p><p>Brad Tuttle is a reporter at TIME.
