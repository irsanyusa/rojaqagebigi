In&nbsp;this article, we&nbsp;have combined creative fan art that portrays our favorite little kid cartoon characters as&nbsp;grown-ups! We&nbsp;have also tried to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;bit what their adult lives would look like.</p><p><h2>1. Moana, Moana</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b0/40e/9b18e25553ae9c81ce14eef73f.jpg><p>Rumor has it&nbsp;that Moana has become a&nbsp;new sea goddess. Now she lives in&nbsp;harmony with herself and nature. However, she never forgets her old friends and still believes in&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;singing.</p><p><h2>2. Boo, Monsters Inc.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb5/079/b58d4b50929f430bbc158d1052.jpg><p>Boo loves to&nbsp;unveil secrets and isn’t afraid of&nbsp;monsters which is&nbsp;why as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, she works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;journalist. She still remembers her childhood stories and cannot wait to&nbsp;tell them to&nbsp;her children.</p><p><h2>3. Dora, Dora the Explorer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9b/7f2/8ee1e55424a5bf7784b9cbf954.jpg><p>Dora is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough, muscular young woman now.

Scooby and Shaggy, Scooby-Doo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0dd/a51/8dd74a58c8b51489e1d791f76d.jpg><p>Scooby and Shaggy have stayed best friends forever. They grew old together and now share quiet evenings with pizza and memories of&nbsp;their adventures.

Lisa Simpson, The Simpsons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/803/711/bd87145166a999eaa86d824dca.jpg><p>Lisa Simpson grew up&nbsp;into a&nbsp;stylish lady.

Since they don’t have to&nbsp;worry about money, they have opened a&nbsp;cafe where every street cat or&nbsp;dog can eat for free. Also, young kittens from poor families are invited for singing and painting lessons, free-of-charge.</p><p><h2>8. Ash Ketchum, Pokémon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6a/025/efa9b75e72885c05656f55a596.jpg><p>Ash has become a&nbsp;Pokémon master.

Together with her family, she continues fighting monsters. She has moved out of&nbsp;her parents’ place and rents an&nbsp;apartment, but she still spends a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with her family.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Mulan and Li&nbsp;Shang, Mulan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d5/762/3e6984553888ae6782d6a77877.jpg><p>Becoming an&nbsp;adult also means that one day our favorite characters will grow old. Some artists also illustrate the Disney couples on&nbsp;pension.
