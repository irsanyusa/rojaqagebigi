"Most of what she wears shows her stomach, so her goal was to have the best abs ever," he said. So, Gaga goes hard with bicycle crunches, typically doing six sets of 20. "They train her abs from every direction," Pasternak said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the food front, Gaga likes to eat lean meats and a lot of veggies, the source told Us Weekly, but she doesnt try to be perfect. She is not afraid to indulge. She will never deprive herself. If she wants something, she eats it, the source explained. And, in super-relatable news, the source also said that Gaga has to have her coffee every day.</p><p>Yassss, Gaga!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOpZidsV2crqitjKOsrKxdm7miwc2tnJ1lmJq%2FbsDOp5ydZZGXwG61zWafnqpdo7K4edKtrKmhlGK5sMLEZqSuq5mYere1w56maJyXoa%2Bzs8Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./risques-industriels-des-elus-pointent-les-lacunes-du-dispositif-bachelot.html><span>←</span><span>des lus pointent les lacunes du dispositif Bachelot</span></a>
