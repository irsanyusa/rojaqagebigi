That way, you won't run into this problem again. Here's how:</p><p><strong>1. Set up the backup-to-email function:</strong> Go to your Facebook <a href=# id=8a850cb3-06e7-341a-a96c-a5d7256c98b9>settings</a> , using the desktop version. Then toggle down to the Notifications tab, scroll down and click to expand the "Email" section. Finally, select the first option, "All notifications except the ones you turn off."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-11015a14-01ea-49d4-bdfe-fde05e91781e data-caption="2 RECOVER DELETED FACEBOOK MESSAGES"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/MqSktktTURBXy84NmJkYjFjNy1mMDQ2LTQwNWItODg5My02MjUyNThiOWI3NmUucG5nkZUCzQMHzQHzwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>2. Download your messages to your computer:</strong> Again on the desktop version, go to your <a href=# id=6dbaf92d-6d0b-32d3-adcd-59e489986077>Facebook settings</a> and, within the "Your Facebook Information" tab, click "Download your information." To only get your messages, click "deselect all" and recheck the box next to "Messages." Then click "Create file." Facebook will email you the file once it's ready for viewing.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-99d30de8-2e97-4140-a9a9-14b188d8fc66 data-caption="3 RECOVER DELETED FACEBOOK MESSAGES"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/UxMktktTURBXy82YTRhMDg2NC1iMzVhLTQyYjEtYTYwZC1mOGQ4MjlhZDg2MTUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQIKwsM></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Related coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech :</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=7eb688a0-98d9-3ceb-ab5e-49afe47faaf7>The best cheap phones you can buy unlocked on Amazon</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWeYpMRuwM5mqZ6bn6uys3nYqKyrZZSauabAxJ1kn5mTmq%2Bwu8pmpJ6ro5a0pr%2BMoqVma12srrq%2FjJqlnWWSlrCswc9msKitomKwtr7RnqWtZ6pmuqWxzGw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./for-men-only-how-to-cheat-on-your-girlfriend-without-getting-caught.html><span>←</span><span>How to cheat on your girlfriend without getting caught</span></a>
