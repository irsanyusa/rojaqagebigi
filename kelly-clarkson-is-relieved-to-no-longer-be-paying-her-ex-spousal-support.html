According to court documents, Clarkson claims Blackstock told her she wasn’t sexy enough to appear on The Voice.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-no-longer-paying-spousal-support>Kelly Clarkson No Longer Paying Spousal Support</h2><p>“Kelly is feeling relieved that her spousal support to Brandon has come to an end,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>. “She’s been ready for this for a while now and is so happy her payments to Brandon will be complete. It’s so nice knowing that this chapter of her life can close with the new year.”</p><p>Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock in 2020, and the couple eventually settled in 2022. The singer agreed to pay her ex $115,000 in monthly spousal support until January 2024. She also agreed to pay $45,601 a month in child support&nbsp;until the couple’s two children either turn 18, graduate high school, or become self-supporting.</p><p>Blackstock also served as Clarkson’s manager during their marriage. Last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was ordered to pay</a> Clarkson over $2 million after it was found that he overcharged her for booking gigs on projects such as&nbsp;The Voice.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KELLY CLARKSON SAYS SHE’S STILL NOT READY TO DATE AGAIN: ‘I NEED A LITTLE MORE WORK ON ME’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blackstock-allegedly-told-clarkson-she-wasn-t-a-sex-symbol>Blackstock Allegedly Told Clarkson She Wasn’t a Sex Symbol</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> has reported that, according to court documents filed as part of Clarkson’s claim against her ex-husband last year, Blackstock told the singer she wasn’t sexy enough to be a coach on The Voice, comparing her to Rihanna.</p><p>Clarkson reportedly testified that she told Blackstock she wanted to be a coach on The Voice for years, but he told her that executives were “looking for a more sex symbol type” like Rihanna. Blackstock also reportedly told her that the show wanted a Black coach “to have a diverse thing,” and argued that she and former coach Blake Shelton were “too similar.”</p><p>When Clarkson’s lawyer Ed McPherson asked how she was able to remember her conversation with Blackstock, the singer responded, “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_ChristinaAguilera_Taylor-HillGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Christina Aguilera Kicks Off Her Las Vegas Residency Following Weight Loss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>brandon blackstock</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlmah6s7HLopyvnZRiwbB5zahkpaeenLKzecGeZKmZqZ67qHnHnqlmnahiwLG71KyYpWWjqr2xu9GtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pays-de-craon-des-etudiants-ouvrent-les-horizons-du-territoire-53.html><span>←</span><span>des tudiants ouvrent les horizons du territoire (53)</span></a>
