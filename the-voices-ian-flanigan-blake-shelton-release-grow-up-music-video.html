He competed on Team Blake and has officially released his first single with his former coach. After months of anticipation Flanigan has released a music video for the song.</strong></p><p>“Grow Up” originally Flanigan and Shelton premiered the single on The Voice stage in May 2021. Since then, country fans couldn’t wait to see this song as a music video. The music video went live on February 18 and featured three time golden-globe nominee Eric Roberts. Roberts is known for being in the films <a href=#>Runaway Train</a>, King of the Gypsies, and The Dark Knight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Music Video Perfectly Portrays The Tale of Feeling Young at Any Age</h2><p>The theme of the music video is feeling young, no matter your age. The creators of the video portrayed this through opening the video at a nursing home. The storyline follows Roberts through his escape from the nursing home to relive his youth. In the reliving, Roberts’ character buys a cowboy hat and boots, and hot wires a car. From there he adventures around in the car with a past lover. Flanigan’s band follows Robert’s character throughout his entire journey. In the beginning, the band is seen wearing scrubs as if they’re the nursing home following him throughout.</p><p>What I liked the most aside from the storytelling aspect was the color grading of the video. In the beginning, the nursing home has a strong blue tint as if the main character feels stuck in the sad world. Once he makes it out of the home, the rest of the short film has a golden hue to it, as if he’s living the golden age of his life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>I absolutely loved this music video, I think it does a great job of complimenting the meaning of the song. This song portrays a strong story with only the vocals, so it was only fitting that the music video played out with a similar story line.</p><p>Since Flanigan is quite the rising country star, this music video was given a national premiere on both Music Choice’s “Today’s Country” video channel and on CMT. Later, the music video was published to Flanigan’s social media and YouTube videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-ian-flanigan-been-up-to-since-the-voice>What Has Ian Flanigan Been Up to Since The Voice?</h2><p>Soon after The Voice, Flanigan signed a record deal with Reviver Music and a management deal with JLS Artist Management. His first release with Reviver Records is his debut single “Grow Up” featuring Shelton with guest vocals. Over the summer, Flanigan performed in <a href=#>concerts around</a> New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.</p><p>Since the release of the music video for “Grow Up,” Flanigan has surprised fans with another single announcement. His second single, “Under a Southern Sky” is releasing on February 25. He’s shared that the song is about feeling free in a small town on a summer night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CNTOt1EFSiD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website-Thumbnail-7.jpg alt="Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson to Perform at the 2022 ACM Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmv4yimKdllqGur7XGmqVmmpyWuKZ50qGcpayfo3qzscuemKydXZy%2FsMOMrqdmpaWotqR51aKbnqdf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-dogs-bite-each-others-mouths-in-play-813837.html><span>←</span><span>Why Dogs Bite Each Others Mouths in Play</span></a>
