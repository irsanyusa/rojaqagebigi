The American Idol alum recently created a TikTok video addressing her relationship with the legendary composer.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katharine-mcphee-claps-back-at-criticisms-over-her-marriage-with-david-foster>Katharine McPhee Claps Back at Criticisms Over Her Marriage with David Foster</h2><p>In a TikTok video, the singer answered the question, “Why’d you marry David Foster …?” Responding to the text, McPhee lip-synched to the viral audio of Kim Kardashian saying, “‘Cause it’s iconic. And I love to do iconic sh*t.”</p><p>As seen in the video, the songstress was gorgeously looking at a vanity mirror before turning her head towards the camera and reciting her line. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McPhee</a> was wearing a black leather tube top. She then matched this with a pair of black leather pants of the same texture. The singer accessorized her outfit with large silver hoop earrings, silver necklace and rings.</p><a title=@katharinefoster href=# rel=noopener>@katharinefoster</a> 🙋🏻‍♀️💋<a title=fyp href=# rel=noopener>#fyp</a> <a title=katharinemcphee href=# rel=noopener>#katharinemcphee</a> <a title="♬ original sound - kardashianicon" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – kardashianicon</a><p>It’s no secret that the couple had been facing harsh criticisms due to their 34-year age gap. However, that may be the first time that McPhee addressed the rumors in a joking manner.</p><p>In July 2017, the couple announced that they’ve decided to get engage. Amid their confirmation, McPhee was never afraid to strongly defend her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romance</a> with the composer.</p><p>“Y’all should be worrying more about registering to vote and midterms elections than who’s marrying me,” she tweeted in July 2018. “Thank you for coming to my TED talk.”</p><p>McPhee and Foster married each other in June 2019 with an intimate London ceremony. In February 2021, the couple welcomed their son Rennie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reactions-on-the-video-are-mixed>Reactions on the Video are Mixed</h2><p>In the comment section of the TikTok post, reaction of internet users regarding the content were mixed. Others expressed support and are glad that McPhee is flaunting her musician husband.</p><p>“So you could make little musical geniuses,” one person wrote.</p><p>“And it’s clear he ADORES you!” another fan wrote.</p><p>One fan ever wrote that it’s the songstress who’s “iconic in the relationship.” Another fan supported McPhee’s move, advising the singer to not mind the haters and just “live your best life!”</p><p>On the other hand, some detractors also took the time to express their displeasure over McPhee’s content. One user commented that her relationship with the composer is nothing too impressive as “it’s just David Foster.”</p><p>“Me looking up ‘who is David Foster?’ on Google,” another person wrote.</p><p>“‘Why did you marry David Foster?’ [because] you were out of money,” another fan wrote.</p><p>Despite hate comments, McPhee decided to keep it cool and not talk back. It seems the singer is rather busy attending to the needs of their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two-year-</a><a href=#>old Rennie</a>, who has been learning the drums as early as now. Kicking off 2024, Foster uploaded a video of their son playing along to “Rock With You” by Michael Jackson.</p><p>“Drumming into the new year #still2yearsold,” he wrote.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_OliviaJade_JacobElordi-220x147.jpg alt="Did Jacob Elordi, Olivia Jade Giannulli Break Up Again?
