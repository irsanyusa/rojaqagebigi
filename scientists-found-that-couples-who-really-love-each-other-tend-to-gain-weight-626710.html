Married couples gaining weight
Research done by&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;North Carolina followed the weight measurements of&nbsp;more than 8,000 people and it&nbsp;was concluded that a&nbsp;married woman can gain, on&nbsp;average, 24&nbsp;pounds during the first 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;6&nbsp;years of&nbsp;her marriage."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In&nbsp;addition, women who lived with their partners but weren’t married gained 22&nbsp;pounds while women who were dating but weren’t living with their partner gained only 13&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><strong>The study also showed that men gained weight during the transition from being single to&nbsp;being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship,</strong> and it&nbsp;showed that men who cohabited with their other half for more than 2&nbsp;years were twice as&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;gain more than 25&nbsp;pounds than men who did not live with their partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/238/c3e/c9114d5c51a26bb7f1054a41a5.jpg><p>The study reached a&nbsp;conclusion that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong association between romantic relationships and the number of&nbsp;obesity-related results. However, even though weight gain is&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;long-term romantic relationships, there was a&nbsp;significant decrease in&nbsp;smoking and alcohol abuse which shows a&nbsp;willingness of&nbsp;couples to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;healthier lifestyle.</p><p><h2>Newly wedded couples</h2></p><p><strong>More <a href=#>research</a> was done by&nbsp;the National Institute of&nbsp;Health to&nbsp;examine whether weight gain in&nbsp;newly wedded couples was a&nbsp;positive or&nbsp;negative reflection of&nbsp;their happiness.</strong> The study followed couples who had been married for more than 4&nbsp;years and it&nbsp;examined their emotional health and levels of&nbsp;stress. It&nbsp;was found that couples who had recently been happily married were twice more likely to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;weight whereas couples who reported being not as&nbsp;happy with their spouses were less likely to&nbsp;gain weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/035/5c5/e676285a01bb07a72c9a8d0b3d.jpg><p><strong>The study reached the conclusion that happy couples gain more weight because they don’t have the need to&nbsp;attract another partner and they feel happier the way they are. </strong>Whereas couples who feel unhappy in&nbsp;their relationships are unable to&nbsp;gain more weight due to&nbsp;stress. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended for happily married couples who gained weight to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;their <a href=#>BMI</a> because of&nbsp;health issues rather than their appearance.</p><p><h2>Weight gain is&nbsp;contagious</h2></p><p><strong>A&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> done by&nbsp;the New England Journal of&nbsp;Medicine showed that weight gain is&nbsp;also contagious in&nbsp;married couples.</strong> If&nbsp;one partner is&nbsp;gaining weight, the other partner has a&nbsp;37% chance of&nbsp;gaining more weight as&nbsp;well. This is&nbsp;because they adapt to&nbsp;each other’s habits since they spend so&nbsp;much time together. Whereas couples that might be&nbsp;unhappy in&nbsp;their relationships avoid spending time together so&nbsp;it&nbsp;becomes more difficult to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;each other’s eating habits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c6/06b/57b0a855599d5c1f5a236d448f.jpg><p>People holding the study analyzed the social environment, habits and mutual activities of&nbsp;the couples and reached the conclusion that <strong>mutual weight gain derives from both individuals psychologically influencing each other with their eating habits.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/339/176/aadad4547c923b6882d98f8beb.jpg><p><strong>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind that even though these are studies done by&nbsp;health professionals, they only show a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;instances in&nbsp;the world and not the whole world in&nbsp;question</strong>, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;does not apply to&nbsp;everyone. There are always exceptions and it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that when you don’t gain weight when you are married that you are not happy with your partner. These studies were mainly done in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand the living situations of&nbsp;couples and to&nbsp;help fight <a href=# title=obesity data-link=tag>obesity</a>.</p><p><strong>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;vital to&nbsp;</strong><strong>influence</strong><strong> each other in&nbsp;positive ways with healthy eating habits and lifestyles regardless of&nbsp;weight in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;enjoy each other’s company for the rest of&nbsp;your lives.</strong></p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about the results of&nbsp;these studies?
