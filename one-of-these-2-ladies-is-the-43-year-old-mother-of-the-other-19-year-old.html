Still, the 43-year-old looks pretty incredible for her age, which she attributes to her religious skin care, the new website reported.</p><p>“I religiously take care of my skin, and everyday wash my face in the morning and before I go to bed,” <a href=# id=27cb247a-3d1a-47f8-8389-51cf673018d0>Joleen said</a> in a recent interview. “I began taking care of my skin at a young age, around 12 or 13. My mom used to buy Mary Kay and I would secretly use her skin care products. A product that has shown dramatic change for me is, tretinoin. Most people know it as Retin-A. I’ve been using it now for about a year and a half, and I’ve seen my skin just get better and better.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Having good skin gives me confidence, even on the days I don’t look my best,” Diaz added.</p><p>Joleen Diaz disclosed that she made Meilani start the same rigorous skincare routine at age 12, to make sure that she had the same radiant skin.</p><p>Aside from the skincare, she also works out, follows a balanced, healthy diet, gets plenty of rest, and above all, she maintains a laidback attitude, not worrying too much about the past or the future, reports say.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I’m pretty pragmatic, and try not to worry too much about the past or anticipate worries in the future,” the 43-year-old said. “I live a pretty simple life and I’m content with what I have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHywusRmpp9lpJ2ytLGMa2SlmZSesrR5yKxkraCVYoF0ediemKtln6GxbrnOrZ%2Beql2ks27Ax55kqKyYmr9ufZhmsJ6ZomK8rbCOo3CspJKtwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1426457-ned-lukes-biography-age-net-worth-movies-death-rumours-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ned Luke's biography: age, net worth, movies, death rumours</span></a>
