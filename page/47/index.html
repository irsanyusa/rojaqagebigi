Languages encompass us; it’s up to us to embrace them. The same applies to inspiration&nbsp; – it is all around us, but we are the ones that choose to be fuelled by our findings in our journey of life. A certain quote that comes to mind here:
&nbsp;“Life is a journey, not a destination.”&nbsp;

According to one Yusuf Abubakar, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed is not proud of his religion and tribe, saying that for him to warn that he won’t accept to be referred to as a Muslim or northerner means he is ungrateful to the Almighty. “If he has publicly said that he does not support tribalism, then nobody would comment on that because tribalism can destroy the entire country,” he added. Another person who spoke to reporters, Babangida Ahmed, said that Baba-Ahmed has destroyed his political career in the north, saying that with such utterances, northerners may not cast their votes for Labour Party in 2023.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Laine Hardy, Alyssa Raghu, and Payton Taylor Are Back.

Morning Consult data continues to show little weakness in the labor market, with the incidence of lost pay or income near series lows and the share of employed adults who are actively looking for a new job on the rise. While quits rates have fallen from their post-pandemic peaks, a large share of workers are still finding it beneficial to seek out new jobs.
