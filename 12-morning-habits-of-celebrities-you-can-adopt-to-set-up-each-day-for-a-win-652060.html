<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>12 Morning Habits of Celebrities You Can Adopt to Set Up Each Day for a Win</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Most successful people have lots of&nbsp;things in&nbsp;common. For example, they all agree that the first thing you should do&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning is&nbsp;<a href=#>to&nbsp;eat a&nbsp;frog</a>. This means that it’s better to&nbsp;deal with the worst thing in&nbsp;your to-do list right after waking&nbsp;up. Among other features of&nbsp;their daily routine, there’s usually a&nbsp;well-balanced and strictly organized daily schedule that helps them thrive in&nbsp;both their careers and personal lives.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> gathered 12&nbsp;morning habits of&nbsp;famous people you should adopt to&nbsp;turn your life into a&nbsp;success!</p><p><h2>12. Jennifer Aniston: Get up&nbsp;early.</h2></p><p>You’ve probably heard that most successful people are <a href=#>early birds</a>, and <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a> is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception here. Every work day, <strong>she gets up&nbsp;at&nbsp;4:30&nbsp;AM and immediately starts doing her morning rituals</strong>.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her morning routine, Jen washes her face with soap, drinks hot water with lemon, then <a href=# title=meditates data-link=tag>meditates</a> for 20&nbsp;minutes. Getting up&nbsp;early allows her to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;head start on&nbsp;the day and <strong>have some quality time for herself</strong> before going to&nbsp;work.</p><p><h2>11. Oprah Winfrey: meditation</h2></p><p>The benefits of&nbsp;<a href=#>meditation</a> are well-known to&nbsp;many&nbsp;— it&nbsp;helps <strong>reduce stress, improve productivity, boost creativity, and maintain general well-being</strong>. That’s why <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey" data-link=tag>Oprah Winfrey</a> usually includes meditation in&nbsp;her daily routine.</p><p>Oprah starts each morning with <strong>20&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;sitting meditation</strong>, not skipping holidays and weekends. She says that sitting in&nbsp;stillness fills her with hope, a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;contentment, and deep joy. However, if&nbsp;she’s in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush, she only meditates for 10-12&nbsp;minutes, but twice a&nbsp;day as&nbsp;usual.</p><p><h2>10. Tim Ferriss: Accomplish small goals.</h2></p><p>Tim Ferriss knows all about <a href=#>success</a>, simply because he&nbsp;has interviewed thousands of&nbsp;great leaders from all walks of&nbsp;life. “<strong>Win the morning, win the day,</strong>” is&nbsp;Tim’s motto expressed in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his books.</p><p>Ferriss chooses to&nbsp;start his days by&nbsp;clearing both his room and his mind, and that’s why he&nbsp;does the easiest but most annoying task first: <strong>he&nbsp;makes his bed</strong>. This simple action gives him a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;pride and accomplishment. Having done this, he&nbsp;can be&nbsp;sure that there is&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one thing in&nbsp;his life that is&nbsp;absolutely under his control, and all the rest is&nbsp;not worth worrying about.</p><p><h2>9. Lea Michele: take a&nbsp;steam shower.</h2></p><p>Each morning after a&nbsp;quick cup of&nbsp;coffee, Lea Michele takes a&nbsp;<a href=#>steam shower</a>. She steams for a&nbsp;really long time on&nbsp;even her busiest days because <strong>this procedure helps her depuff and sweat out all of&nbsp;the toxins from her body</strong>.</p><p>When taking a&nbsp;shower, Michele <strong>exfoliates her body twice</strong>&nbsp;— she starts by&nbsp;dry brushing and then uses a&nbsp;homemade scrub containing coconut oil, brown sugar or&nbsp;sea salt, and olive oil and stores it&nbsp;right in&nbsp;the bathroom.</p><p><h2>8. Richard Branson: Spend time with your family.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that Branson is&nbsp;not the only early bird in&nbsp;his family. No&nbsp;matter what he’s up&nbsp;to&nbsp;later, Richard wakes up&nbsp;at&nbsp;around 5&nbsp;AM, works out, and eats his breakfast. However, the most important part of&nbsp;his morning is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spending time with his family</a>.</p><p>Branson says that some <strong>quality family time puts him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;great frame of&nbsp;mind</strong> before getting down to&nbsp;business. According to&nbsp;some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>studies</a>, it&nbsp;also reduces stress, improves your health, and extends the length of&nbsp;your life.</p><p><h2>7. Jessica Alba: Work out with your friends.</h2></p><p>All successful people know the importance of&nbsp;exercising. And <strong>if&nbsp;you don’t work out in&nbsp;the morning, you most likely won’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the evening</strong> when you feel tired after all your day’s events. At&nbsp;the same time, it’s so&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;make yourself get up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit earlier to&nbsp;perform when you know that you could spend this time in&nbsp;your cozy bed.</p><p><a href=# title="Jessica Alba" data-link=tag>Jessica Alba</a> found a&nbsp;<a href=#>way out of&nbsp;this situation</a>&nbsp;— she uses her workout buddies to&nbsp;help her turn early morning sweat sessions into a&nbsp;reality. The actress admits that exercising is&nbsp;not her favorite activity, but it&nbsp;helps her reduce stress, and <strong>her friends always keep her motivated </strong>to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some yoga or&nbsp;spinning classes together.</p><p><h2>6. Brittany Snow: Make your own “getting ready” playlist.</h2></p><p>Even if&nbsp;you usually get up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the wrong side of&nbsp;the bed, you can easily <strong>change your negative mood into a&nbsp;positive one by&nbsp;using some good tunes</strong>. The Pitch Perfect star Brittany Snow calls it&nbsp;a&nbsp;“<a href=#>getting ready</a>” playlist.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, after breakfast, she puts on&nbsp;her own playlist filled with mood-boosting songs that she blasts on&nbsp;the speakers throughout her house. It&nbsp;helps her to&nbsp;<strong>wake up&nbsp;quickly and set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;proper mood</strong> for the rest of&nbsp;the day.</p><p><h2>5. Julianne Hough: Express gratitude.</h2></p><p>Julianne Hough prefers to&nbsp;start her day on&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive note by&nbsp;performing her own morning <a href=#>gratitude ritual</a>. Right after waking up&nbsp;at&nbsp;6:30&nbsp;AM, <strong>she sits up&nbsp;in&nbsp;her bed and thinks of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>5&nbsp;things she’s grateful for</strong> that either already happened to&nbsp;her or&nbsp;that she wants to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that day.</p><p>Julianne also <strong>sets some small spiritual goals for the following 24&nbsp;hours.</strong> This can be&nbsp;something like making 10&nbsp;people smile throughout the day, for example. Only after this does she get out of&nbsp;bed, brush her teeth, and proceed with her other morning routines.</p><p><h2>4. David Karp: Don’t check your emails.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f16/d00/e7a65651958a2ac54d30c542c0.jpg><p>The founder and CEO of&nbsp;Tumblr David Karp is&nbsp;sure that <a href=#>reading emails</a> in&nbsp;the morning at&nbsp;home never feels good or&nbsp;productive. Instead, <strong>he&nbsp;saves all of&nbsp;his email reading for when he&nbsp;arrives at&nbsp;work</strong> at&nbsp;about 9:30&nbsp;AM or&nbsp;10:00&nbsp;AM. If&nbsp;there’s something urgent that he&nbsp;should know about, people always can call or&nbsp;text him.</p><p>David also <strong>set up&nbsp;filters on&nbsp;his email </strong>so&nbsp;that his inbox gets messages only from the staff working in&nbsp;his company and from his girlfriend&nbsp;— the rest of&nbsp;his emails go&nbsp;into the “unsorted” folder. When he&nbsp;arrives at&nbsp;his office, he&nbsp;goes through his inbox folder and responds to&nbsp;all the messages. After that, he&nbsp;opens the “unsorted” folder and checks if&nbsp;there’s anything important there.</p><p><h2>3. Kate Hudson: Make an&nbsp;ice bath for your face.</h2></p><p>Kate Hudson usually <strong>wakes up&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice bath</strong>. She adopted this habit from a&nbsp;makeup artist she worked with and started doing it&nbsp;every single morning.</p><p>To&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>facial ice bath</a>, Kate uses a&nbsp;bowl filled with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;ice and a&nbsp;little water. She sticks her face in&nbsp;and tries to&nbsp;stay there as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;she can. <strong>This freezing bath wakes her up&nbsp;really quickly and also softens her facial skin and gives her a&nbsp;glow</strong>.</p><p><h2>2. Mark Zuckerberg: Eliminate choices.</h2></p><p>Of&nbsp;course, having lots of&nbsp;choices may seem awesome and even luxurious for some of&nbsp;us. But when you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry in&nbsp;the morning, wasting those precious minutes on&nbsp;deciding what to&nbsp;wear or&nbsp;to&nbsp;eat may actually turn your day into a&nbsp;complete disaster. That’s why many wealthy and successful people have voluntarily chosen to&nbsp;<strong>eliminate their decisions throughout the day</strong>.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the greatest examples of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;seen by&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that he&nbsp;has about 20&nbsp;identical gray T-shirts in&nbsp;his closet. This lack of&nbsp;choice helps him <strong>avoid decision fatigue and focus his attention on&nbsp;business</strong>.</p><p><h2>1. Steve Jobs: Remind yourself of&nbsp;your dreams.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;his <a href=#>speech</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;graduating class at&nbsp;Stanford, Jobs said that each morning he&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;the mirror and asked himself the same question: “<strong>If&nbsp;today was the last day of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, would&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what I’m doing today?</strong>” Whenever his answer was “no” for too many days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row, he&nbsp;was sure that he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;change something in&nbsp;his life.</p><p>This kind of&nbsp;reevaluation of&nbsp;his work and desires every single day helped him <strong>pursue his dreams without forgetting about his true self</strong>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have your own morning habits that help you get a&nbsp;head start on&nbsp;the day?
