At the end of the night, Baby Mammoth was unmasked as actress Kirstie Alley after a duel with fellow Team Cuddly member Space Bunny.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-s-baby-mammoth-unmasked-as-kirstie-alley>‘The Masked Singer’s Baby Mammoth Unmasked as Kirstie Alley</h2><p>Baby Mammoth performed “The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss)” for this week’s solo performance. She also had the judges laughing after she sang with a made-up song about her name. The show revealed a birdcage as a Mega Clue about her.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Mammoth was in the bottom two with fellow Team Cuddly member Space Bunny. They had a duel, with Mammoth singing “Me Too” by Meghan Trainor and Space Bunny taking on “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me” by Culture Club.</p><p>Mammoth received the least amount of votes and had to be unmasked. Guesses included Rachael Ray, Reese Witherspoon, and Kirsten Dunst. Nicole Scherzinger initially guessed that it might be Jenny McCarthy’s cousin Melissa McCarthy.</p><p>McCarthy herself guessed that it was Cheers actress Kirstie Alley, and she was the only judge who got it right. Alley shared that the birdcage was a reference to her many animals, including 15 lemurs. She said she hoped her grandkids enjoyed seeing her on stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-queen-cobra-confuses-the-judges-yet-again>Queen Cobra Confuses the Judges Yet Again</h3><p>Last week, the judges weren’t sure if Queen Cobra was one celebrity or several. There seemed to be six of them on stage at once, but only one of them talked to the panel. This week, Cobra returned with two singers in the spotlight and several backup vocalists. They sang “Say a Little Prayer.”</p><p>The judges were blown away by the performance, with Robin Thicke predicting that they’ll make it to the finale. McCarthy is convinced that it’s Brandy and Monica, especially after their Mega Clue turned out to be a valentine with the message “B. Mine” (as in “The Boy Is Mine”).</p><p>Prince also delivered another great performance this week with a cover of “Lay Me Down” by Sam Smith that had Scherzinger breaking down in tears. She called Prince’s performance “very honest.” McCarthy thinks he’ll make it to the finale. Guesses included Niall Horan and Darren Criss.</p><p>Which of the remaining three contestants will join <a href=#>Firefly</a> and <a href=#>Ringmaster</a> in the finale? Will it be a clean sweep for Team Good? We’ll find out next week.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NUP_197277_02779.jpeg alt="Grammy-Nominated Singer Tenelle Represents American Samoa on ‘American Song Contest’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6s7HCmqdmmpGXxm65wKakqKyYYsKvucCsop6cXZaztbHRZquemZ1isLaww6WwZpylmrlw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-amanda-lacount-americas-got-talents-dancer-out-to-break-stereotypes-2.html><span>←</span><span>America's Got Talent's Dancer Out To Break Stereotypes</span></a>
