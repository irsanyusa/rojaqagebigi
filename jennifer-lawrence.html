She landed her first major acting role on the TBS comedy series "The Bill Engvall Show," which ran for three seasons from 2007 to 2009. After her sitcom stint, Lawrence made the jump to acting with a breakthrough appearance in the 2010 indie drama "Winter's Bone." The film became a sensation at the Sundance Film Festival that year and garnered Lawrence her first Oscar nomination for best actress. Lawrence took on her first major Hollywood tentpole with "X-Men: First Class" (2011), in which she took on the role of Mystique. She reprised the character in three more movies: "X-Men: Days of Future Past" (2014), "X-Men: Apocalypse" (2016) and "Dark Phoenix" (2019). Lawrence became a global superstar by landing the role of Katniss Everdeen in "The Hunger Games" franchise, which launched in 2012 and spanned four films through 2015. The franchise grossed $2.9 billion at the worldwide box office with Lawrence at the forefront. She won the Academy Award for best actress thanks to her role in David O. Russell's "Silver Linings Playbook" (2012), and her collaborations with the director on "American Hustle" (2013) and "Joy" (2015) also landed her Oscar nominations. Additional film credits include Darren Aronofsky's "mother!" (2017), Adam McKay's "Don't Look Up" (2021), Lila Neugebauer's "Causeway" (2022) and Gene Stupnitsky's R-rated comedy "No Hard Feelings" (2023).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfKuxzaegn52iYrmiw9GepZydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lancement-de-ledition-2008-de-vacances-propres.html><span>←</span><span>Lancement de l'dition 2008 de Vacances Propres</span></a>
