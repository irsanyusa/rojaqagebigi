And we’re already starting to get some clues and performances from the new characters. None have been more dynamic than <a href=#>The Bull</a>, who lit up the stage in the Sneak Peek with his performance of “Circus” by <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>.</strong></p><p id=block-828b18b1-7114-43f5-a5f4-7f5423f1ca94>So what clues do we have so far? And who is under the Bull mask? We’ve decoded all the clues and came up with our prediction for The Masked Singer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 6</h2><p>We haven’t gotten a lot of clues yet about the Bull, but the <a href=#>sneak peek</a> showed a picture of a tiger and a lion as the Bull’s first clue. In his <a href=#>first clue package</a>, the Bull kicks it off by saying he grew up in a “small, small town…surrounded by cows.” The Bull claims that most people in his hometown didn’t really go anywhere, but he left and traveled around the entire world, looking for his “destiny.” He wants to be the “greatest of all time.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 6 SNEAK PEEK RECAP</a></strong></p><p>The Bull is shown in a rowboat a la “George Washington Crossing the Delaware” throughout his clues. The clues show a map with Cooperstown highlighted. Robin mentions that’s where the Baseball Hall of Fame is. Then, the Bull mentions he knocked on doors but “heard ‘no’ again and again and again.” He became his own boss! Eventually, Hollywood and Forbes took notice of him. We see the Astronaut from season 3 (who was Hunter Hayes) float by. Finally, a stuffed animal lion is shown sitting on a rock.</p><p>There will be many more clues to come for the Bull, since he’s a strong performer. He probably isn’t going anywhere any time soon!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Bull</h2><p>Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg predicted the Bull could be a boy band member, like Brian Littrell. Robin said it could be Sisqo with dance moves like that. Ken guessed Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson but gets boo’ed. Nicole says she’s pretty sure she knows who it is, but she doesn’t want to say because she might lead other judges to the right answer too. Online, fans of the show are buzzing about who could be under the Bull mask. The most popular guesses are YouTuber Todrick Hall, actor and singer Jordan Fisher, actor Billy Porter, and basketball player Dennis Rodman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is The Bull on The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-368e3453-5d4b-4448-a575-0fe21bda999f>The Bull’s performance and walkout really gave away his identity.

It’s uncanny! Now, we’ll go through how the clues line up for him.</p><p>The one clue we did get before the season, a lion and tiger, is a nod to his song with Amber Riley, called <a href=#>Lions and Tigers</a>. It might not be much, but it makes a lot of sense. When it comes to the new clues, his hometown mention is perfect for Todrick, who was born in Plainview, Texas. The town is known for its beef processing plant that was the largest employer in the city.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER MOTHER NATURE CLUES DECODED + OUR PREDICTION</a></strong></p><p>When he mentions hearing “no” again and again, that could be referencing how he got his start on <a href=#>American Idol</a>, but didn’t win and didn’t have much commercial success after it. In turn, he decided to make his own YouTube channel, where he found fame on his own terms. Forbes listed Todrick Hall in their “30 Under 30” list in 2014, also explaining that mention. His tie to Hunter Hayes is that he’s covered his hit song, “Invisible,” which has now been set to “Private” on his YouTube channel. Very suspicious indeed!</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Do you agree with our prediction? Or are there any clues we missed?
