In a recent interview with People, the White Lotus star has recently opened up about how she gathered strength after experiencing deep-seated heartbreak.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-haley-lu-richardson-discusses-getting-over-her-past-heartbreak>Haley Lu Richardson Discusses Getting Over Her Past Heartbreak</h2><p>In November 2022, the actress confirmed her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">split</a> from her ex-fiancé Brett Dier, stating that they had separated two years prior. Richardson and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jane the Virgin</a> alum were a couple for more than seven years. Now, three years after their breakup, the actress is getting honest about the overwhelming experience.</p><p>“It was hard, but I got through it—that’s important and what matters,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “I was in a really long relationship, I spent a lot of life with someone, and it was very special. I thought it could be forever, but it wasn’t, I had thought the whole time we were together that if it wasn’t going to be forever, my life would just stop.”</p><p>Of her newfound strength, Richardson said that she’s proud of how she overcame that rough patch. However, the actress is not crediting everything to herself. She most especially thanks therapy for teaching her to embrace her emotions.</p><p>“Once you do it, and once you start feeling how it’s totally affecting, in the best ways, every single aspect of your life, it becomes a part of your life,” she said.</p><p>Aside from seeking professional help, Richardson also credits her mental growth to dance. In the past year, she’s shared videos of herself dancing, treating as her way to release her vulnerability.</p><p>“Dance has been a huge grounding thing for me because I feel so deeply,” she says. “It’s very cathartic to be able to connect your body to those emotions that I feel.”</p><p>Social media has also become Richardson’s space to let out her thoughts. Without giving much specifics about her pains, she tells fans that she wasn’t exactly doing great.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-gushes-over-extreme-love-of-the-jonas-brothers>She Gushes Over Extreme Love of The Jonas Brothers</h2><p>As she discovers herself in the process, she also eagerly pursues her dream. Interestingly, she has an adorable reason for wanting to be an actress.</p><p>“This is really embarrassing to say, but it’s sincere,” she said. “One of the reasons was because maybe I could get famous enough to meet the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jonas Brothers</a> one day.”</p><p>Richardson was able to successfully check that out from her bucket list. Earlier this year, the Jonas Brothers casted her as the star of their dance-heavy music video for “Wings,” the lead single off the band’s latest LP, The Album.</p><p>“Those kinds of dreams don’t come true, but it did for me,” she said. “And it’s not lost on me. I am very thankful. It was the coolest thing.”</p><p>Now, she doesn’t only wish to be a fan. She also wants to be their friend.</p><p>“I do really want to be their friend now. But I think they’re scared of me because I’m such a fan,” she jokes. “I really want them to know that I feel like I’m ready to be their friend if they would like that.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_MatthewPerry_ZacEfron-220x147.jpg alt="Zac Efron Would Be ‘Honored’ to Portray Matthew Perry in Biopic: ‘He Was a Mentor to Me’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Haley Lu Richardson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>White Lotus</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGgrZ1doby1wdJmqq2ZomK1orjEsmSlrV2ntqS0wKubrKeeYrSmwNJmmpqmlJ6xbq3BqKytZZiav265xKermqRdqMGzwcago56rXZaztbHRZpuenaBitaat0a2Zq52RoHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ir-a-infinitive-spanish.html><span>←</span><span>Using the near future in Spanish: ir + a + infinitive</span></a>
