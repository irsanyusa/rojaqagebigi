The new Harris Poll survey, which was conducted from February to March 2023 and commissioned by the American Academy of Physician Associates, shows that <a href=# rel=noopener>patient satisfaction is also suffering</a> due to the high costs, inaccessibility, and confusing logistics of U.S. medical care.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than half of the roughly 2,500 U.S. adults who took the survey graded the U.S. health care system a “C” or below. When asked about factors that prevent people in the U.S. from getting care, cost was the most common criticism, followed by the system’s focus on profits, inaccessibility of insurance coverage, and confusion around what is covered by insurance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many respondents pointed to similar problems when asked about their own personal issues with the medical system. Only 27% of people who took the survey said the U.S. medical system meets all of their needs, while the rest listed complaints including how long it takes to get an appointment (31% of respondents), high costs (26%), limitations of insurance coverage (23%), and subpar focus on preventive care and wellness (19%).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those complaints seem to be keeping at least some would-be patients away from the doctor’s office. More than a fifth of people surveyed said they don’t see a single health care provider on a regular basis, and 44% said they’d <a href=# rel=noopener>skipped or delayed needed care</a> in the past two years. Among those who skipped or delayed appointments, 40% said they did so because of costs, while 30% said they couldn’t take time away from work, family, or other obligations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The survey did, however, suggest some bright spots and paths forward. More than 75% of survey participants said that providers work with them to improve their health, more than 70% said they want stronger relationships with their providers, and more than 65% said they believe their health would improve if they regularly worked with a trusted provider—responses that suggest Americans haven’t totally given up on the system, despite their frustrations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamduhnSDjq6qZqCVlrm1tIycmKudXajGtMDEpmSarKSewbawxKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooke-shields-time-magazine-pretty-baby.html><span>←</span><span>Brooke Shields on Pretty Baby and Being the Face of the '80s</span></a>
