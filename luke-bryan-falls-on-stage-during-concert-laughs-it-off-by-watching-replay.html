In a video shared on social media, the singer can be seen slipping on something and falling backwards as the crowd gasps. Bryan laughs as he sits up. He then picks up a cell phone, which is apparently what caused the fall.</p><p>“Hold up, did anybody get that?” Bryan asked after he stood up from the stage. He then threw the phone back into the crowd, joking, “My lawyer will be calling.”</p><p>Someone in the audience captured the moment on their phone, which they handed to Bryan. He played the video, which was added to the big screen behind him. The crowd laughed together as they watched a replay of Bryan’s fall.</p><p>“Hey, I need some viral,” Bryan said of the clip. “This is viral, all right? This is viral.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LUKE BRYAN REACTS TO KATY PERRY LEAVING ‘AMERICAN IDOL’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryan-performed-on-american-idol-this-week>Bryan Performed on American Idol This Week</h2><p>It looked like Bryan might have hurt his elbow in the fall over the weekend, but it doesn’t appear to have been serious. The singer was back at the American Idol judging table on Sunday night for the live show, and he also took the stage to perform.</p><p>Bryan sang “Small Town” by John Mellencamp while playing the guitar. The remaining Season 22 contestants smiled and clapped along during the performance. On Monday night, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">competition was narrowed down</a> to the Top 10 singers.</p><p>The show will be back this Sunday night with a new episode, as the remaining contestants fight for another chance to be named the winner.
