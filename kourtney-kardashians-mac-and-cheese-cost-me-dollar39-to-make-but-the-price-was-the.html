But apparently, even the self-proclaimed health-obsessed Kourt isn't immune to the lure of delicious mac and cheese.

Since I'm not a huge fan of non-dairy cheese substitutes, I stuck with dairy cheese instead.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I did have two qualms about the ingredients for this particular recipe. First, all of these organic ingredients are not readily available at all grocery stores so I ended up taking two trips to the grocery store. And secondly, I found that organic ingredients are a bit expensive. To make this dish I spent a whopping $39, which is not exactly what I'd like to spend to make a dish as simple as mac and cheese.</p><p>But aside from these small details, the ingredients were very familiar to me and quite standard, minus the gluten-free, organic requirements that I'm not used to.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>The mac and cheese came together pretty well.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9b5f1f28-c08d-428f-a66c-1cdadedce406 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/q4UktkuTURBXy8wYjU4YWJjMC1lNWEzLTQ2NjktOGQ3OS0yNjg1ZDQ3ODBjMzMuanBlZ5GVAs0CgM0B4MLD></span><p>Samantha Gutierrez</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Although the flour clumped a bit when I added it to the sauce (it probably was my fault and not the recipe's), the cooking of the pasta and cheese sauce went off without a hitch.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>I did notice a slight missing bit of information in the recipe.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ab9adc4f-cb00-48d2-ad3f-4b5621031697 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/FZgktkuTURBXy8yNjkxYzQ1NC03ZjFkLTRmZDctYjM1OS1hMTZmMGViY2FkYTUuanBlZ5GVAs0CgM0B4MLD></span><p>Samantha Gutierrez</p><p>The recipe itself was also pretty easy to follow except for one little detail it never says when to add in the turkey bacon that's listed in the ingredients.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It's clearly meant to be included in the recipe it's in the ingredient list and recipe name after all but the recipe doesn't mention how to cook it or when to include it, whether that was a slight mishap on her part or an omission when the recipe was posted on People, I'm not sure.</p><p>Anyway, left to my own devices, I cooked the bacon according to package instructions and mixed it in a few minutes before the whole dish was done.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>The end result was ... underwhelming.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8ce0bd20-5d8f-469c-a116-b865920000ff data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/lKJktkuTURBXy85ZDdiNDRlYS03OGUxLTRjN2QtYmRlYS0yYjdmNTIwNjkyZjcuanBlZ5GVAs0CgM0B4MLD></span><p>Samantha Gutierrez</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So what did the mac and cheese taste like? Overall, I felt it was pretty meh. I, along with my boyfriend and best friend, tried the dish with good faith but came to the consensus that it was simply unimpressive.</p><p>As my friend pointed out, "The bacon gives it flavor, otherwise, it would be very bland." And in the words of my boyfriend, "It tasted like pasta with butter." I wouldn't normally mind pasta with butter except that I was expecting a creamy mac and cheese. In this case, the macaroni's texture was just greasy. You could even see the oil from the mac and cheese shining on the plate when served.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>Myself and my taste-testers felt the dish lacked flavor.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a99bd807-f7d4-4147-9205-686805bcf42f data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/7F4ktktTURBXy8xNTc1Nzk4My1iNDVkLTQ1ZjYtYjBjZC00YmY0OTRhYzI5MzQuanBnkZUCzQKAzQHgwsM></span><p>Samantha Gutierrez</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>All in all, the whole thing tasted quite bland and it was messy. We even tried adding more salt and a dash of red pepper flakes in an attempt to bring a little flavor into the mix. Even that couldn't convince us to get seconds.</p><p>I and my taste-testers couldn't even tell the recipe contained flavorful pepper jack cheese, mustard powder, or even salt.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>I won't be making this dish again.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9eb5570a-3efa-466d-8ae9-993923581d08 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3pJktkuTURBXy8yMGU1MjhlNC1hNDE3LTQ0NTMtOWVkZS0wZDY0YzMyNzFkNDEuanBlZ5GVAs0CgM0B4MLD></span><p>Samantha Gutierrez</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The leftovers have now survived three days in the fridge, which is a rarity considering my boyfriend is quick to eat anything in sight.
