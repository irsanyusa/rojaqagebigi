In&nbsp;a&nbsp;September 2023 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with <i>Vogue</i> magazine, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>48-year-old</a> actress opened up&nbsp;about all things relating to&nbsp;her new own fashion brand, Atelier Jolie, including what motivated her to&nbsp;venture professionally into the fashion industry. Given she’s a&nbsp;very family-oriented person, it’s no&nbsp;wonder her daughter’s struggles moved her to&nbsp;the business.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Jolie, her daughter Zahara, whom she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopted</a> at&nbsp;6-months-old from an&nbsp;orphanage in&nbsp;Ethiopia on&nbsp;July&nbsp;6, 2005, doesn’t have an&nbsp;easy time finding clothing that suits her skin tone. If&nbsp;you’re thinking this issue is&nbsp;something that you’ve never thought about before, you’re not alone. Jolie herself admitted that.</p><p>“Obviously, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;white woman, I’ve never had this experience,” Jolie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “It&nbsp;never crossed my&nbsp;mind until we&nbsp;went shopping together, and&nbsp;I saw that there’s so&nbsp;much room for improvement.”</p><p><h2>Jolie involved her children in&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;her fashion studio.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8aa/272/fab987566182a4770e8fd18b68.jpg><p>With her children’s issues at&nbsp;heart, Jolie made sure to&nbsp;include them in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>process</a> of&nbsp;creating Atelier Jolie. Zahara herself and Pax, her 19-year-old son whom she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopted</a> from an&nbsp;orphanage in&nbsp;Ho&nbsp;Chi Minh City, Vietnam on&nbsp;March&nbsp;15, 2007, were “heavily involved” in&nbsp;the launch. However, the actress finds a&nbsp;certain irony in&nbsp;the fact that they’re now linked to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;fashion as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family, given neither has never been particularly focused on&nbsp;it.</p><p>“I&nbsp;find it&nbsp;slightly funny that we&nbsp;are involved in&nbsp;fashion&nbsp;— I&nbsp;don’t think any one of&nbsp;us is&nbsp;overly ’fashionable,’” Jolie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, jokingly. “But because we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;our clothes, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;who we&nbsp;are, and something that’s important to&nbsp;explore, especially for young people.”</p><p><h2>Color is&nbsp;key when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;fashion, according to&nbsp;an&nbsp;expert.</h2></p><p>Stylist Cristina Ehrlich, who works with celebrities such as&nbsp;Laura Dern and Natasha Lyonne, emphasized in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> the importance of&nbsp;finding what hue best suits your skin tone. “Color is&nbsp;the number one most important thing to&nbsp;me&nbsp;when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;styling; it’s what makes my&nbsp;service unique,” she revealed. “The first thing I&nbsp;do with a&nbsp;new client is&nbsp;study their skin tone and figure out what’s going to&nbsp;look best. It’s easy to&nbsp;wear black, but color can be&nbsp;so&nbsp;beautiful.”</p><p>With that in&nbsp;mind, <strong>we&nbsp;gathered a&nbsp;few tips from different fashion experts</strong> to&nbsp;help you decide what you should wear next. But remember: feeling comfortable in&nbsp;what you wear is&nbsp;the most important!</p><p><h2>Find what colors suit your skin tone the best:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd9/acb/4773bd569b8fa09f3a7eb2e825.jpg><p>So, those with a&nbsp;<strong>warm skin tone</strong> have several key <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>characteristics</a> that define their color palette and preferences. Firstly, their skin tone likely features a&nbsp;greenish or&nbsp;yellowish undertone, and they may even have an&nbsp;olive complexion. This warm undertone extends to&nbsp;their hair color, which typically falls between dark brown and dark blonde. Additionally, they have a&nbsp;preference for yellow gold jewelry, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;complements their skin tone beautifully.</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;colors that suit them best, warm skin tones harmonize with a&nbsp;spectrum of&nbsp;shades. Warm skin tones are often connected to&nbsp;colors such as&nbsp;orange, yellow, and bright hues. Plus, natural earth tones such as&nbsp;browns, deep tonal reds, and rich greens are also flattering choices. While there aren’t strict rules about colors to&nbsp;avoid, black should only be&nbsp;worn with specific pieces.</p><p>Celebrities like Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Jessica Alba are excellent sources of&nbsp;style inspiration for those with warm skin tones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/598/a53/f9592a5eb6a6ae18634c35715f.jpg><p>People in&nbsp;the <strong>cool-toned</strong> group can have a&nbsp;skin tone that’s either very fair to&nbsp;very dark, however they usually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feature</a> bluish undertones. Their hair color typically ranges from very dark, including blue-black or&nbsp;deep brown shades, to&nbsp;light blonde. Jewelry-wise, they often lean towards silver, rose gold, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;both.</p><p>When selecting colors that complement cooler skin tones, charcoal, cool blues, and violet are excellent choices. However, experts advise that it’s essential to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mindful of&nbsp;strong, bold colors, as&nbsp;they can make cool skin tones appear paler. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;colors to&nbsp;avoid, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;wise to&nbsp;steer clear of&nbsp;overly bold choices like electric blue or&nbsp;grassy green, oranges and yellows.</p><p>For style inspiration, you can look to&nbsp;celebrities like Viola Davis, Nicole Kidman, Lupita Nyong’o and Cate Blanchett, who all showcase cool-toned elegance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea7/d64/92c1be5ba9aeea27095b7f7846.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<strong>neutral skin tone</strong> is&nbsp;one that is&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;categorize as&nbsp;either warm or&nbsp;cool. Similarly, those with this type of&nbsp;skin ton often have a&nbsp;hair color that tends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;blend of&nbsp;different shades, such as&nbsp;blonde with ashy streaks or&nbsp;brown with warmer tones. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;jewelry, they have a&nbsp;versatile approach and enjoy mixing and matching various metals.</p><p>When selecting colors that enhance your neutral skin tone, it’s best to&nbsp;stick with shades that fall in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the color spectrum. However, if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;add some flair to&nbsp;your wardrobe beyond white or&nbsp;beige, experts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggest</a> exploring colors like light peach, dusty pinks, soft rose, peony pink, placid blue, jade green, and cameo green. On&nbsp;the flip side, stay away from colors like reds, yellows, and overly vibrant hues. If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;go&nbsp;for yellow, it’s advisable to&nbsp;select a&nbsp;softer version like cornsilk or&nbsp;buff.</p><p>Celebrities like Selena Gomez, Kerry Washington, Angelina Jolie, and Julia Roberts can be&nbsp;your source of&nbsp;style inspiration, as&nbsp;they showcase the versatility of&nbsp;neutral skin tones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6vs8SloKeZXZ%2B8rbXEZqqhmaKawG7Ax55kraCfqrSpwIypqaiun6C2r7OMq5yaq5%2Bjeri02Gabmq2XncGmvoyzmKGZopZ6tMDRrp6gpJWoerW7jJ%2Bgp5xdmLmwwMeipaBlaGaCeHySaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-okorie-shares-photos-of-badly-bruised-face-says-shes-planning-a-big.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Okorie shares photos of badly bruised face, says she's planning a big thanksgiving</span></a>
