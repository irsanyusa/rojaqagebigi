The actor known from Modern Family shared that this show is the ultimate domino toppling experience.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eric Stonestreet Reveals Why He Took The Job at Domino Masters</h2><p>Domino toppling videos have become viral along with the extremely viral ASMR trend in the past few years. Although domino toppling has become a huge video phenomenon, general ASMR trends typically reference things like slime and general gentle sounds. People love these videos because they they’re an instant form of relaxation. Stonestreet shared that he loves the sound of dominoes toppling.</p><p>“What I loved about it is exactly what you said, I watched these YouTube videos of people setting up Rube Goldberg machines, chain reactions, dominoes in your backyard with hotwheels going through your backyard. I was always obsessed with that,” Stonestreet <a href=#>said</a> on The Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/Caamkn3DIyY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Stonestreet recalls getting the offer for this show and asking his fiancé’s children if they had heard of domino toppling. The nine year old boys told him that they watch domino videos all the time. The actor noted that this ultimately led him to discussing the show with the network.</p><p>“They [the network] sold me on it and I just love celebrating these people who have dedicated their lives to setting up dominoes and its enough now for them that a network is giving them a tv show and honoring them and I wanted to be apart of that,” he <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>FOX’s newest competition series, Domino Masters premieres after <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> on FOX on March 9. New York Times best-selling math book author Danica McKellar, NFL Pro-Bowler and Super Bowl Champion Vernon Davis, and professional chain reaction domino artist Steve Price will make up the judging panel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eric-stonestreet-pops-the-question-to-girlfriend-of-over-five-years>Eric Stonestreet Pops the Question to Girlfriend of Over Five Years</h2><p>Within the interview, Stonestreet mentioned his finacé, Lindsay Schweitzer and her children. He shared that the entire Modern Family cast was excited when the couple got engaged last August. The Modern Family alum proposed to Schweitzer after more than five years of dating.</p><p>The engagement itself was completely impromptu. The actor shared that the special moment didn’t take hours of planning. He shared that it was not a big production. After hearing about the engagement Modern Family co-star Julie Bowen approved of the ring the first time she saw it. Stonestreet joked and said that the ring had to pass both Bowen and <a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a>‘s inspections.</p><p>Before Schweitzer, Stonestreet was the only adult without a partner in real life on Modern Family. He shared that he began bringing his girlfriend to set soon after they began dating. From the start, his co stars loved his partner. It seems like the actor never questioned whether or not Schweitzer was “the one” from the fact that his co-stars immediately loved her.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1209315123.jpg alt="Chrissy Teigen Asks Fans to Stop Asking if She’s Pregnant Amid IVF Journey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>domino masters</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6ikoqafYrqiv9OeqaxlmKTAtXnEq6CcZaOpvK%2Bx0q2pnp2kYsCixdJmq6GdXZi8rrzEraCtoZ%2Bjeqix06xkoqakmru0sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tdie-lance-sa-plate-forme-presidentielle-de-la-mobilite-2012-2017.html><span>←</span><span>TDIE lance sa &amp;quot;plate-forme prsidentielle de la mobilit 2012-2017&amp;quot;</span></a>
