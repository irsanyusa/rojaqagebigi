And I know there’s a standard, but there shouldn’t be one. There shouldn’t be a standard for what people should dress like if they’re artists, or what people should dress like if they’re women. I just feel like we’re all unique. There shouldn’t be a requirement. That’s what I mean by standard. There shouldn’t be a requirement or some kind of expectation that you dress a certain way."</p><p>Karefa Johnson asked, " I wonder if you have recognised that you mean so much to so many people in that way—in a “self-love and acceptance” way and an “authentically expressing yourself” kind of way. Do you accept being designated as somebody who’s pushing that kind of positivity out into the world?"</p><p>In response, Tems expressed appreciation for being seen as a role model in this regard and re-iterated her focus on authenticity.</p><p>"I appreciate that that’s what’s coming across. And I do think people should be themselves. I can’t really be anybody else. It’s just not going to work. You are doing yourself a disservice by trying to be someone else. You should just be who you are. Once you start trying, you’ve already missed the road. That’s a takeaway from how I live my life for sure," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGatoJWnsm6%2Fx6ispZyeqXqjsYyaZKyskaOxor7DZqafZaedrrV5z56mqaSVYsCpu9Slm2acoprAtHnLoqKeZaSaurR71aCeqpqabA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-fashion-nicki-minaj-debuts-new-look-in-alexander-mcqueen.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Debuts New Look In Alexander McQueen!</span></a>
