Do you remember that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chicken that played the piano</a> in Season 12? Well, Season 16 has brought a whole new meaning to chickens with hidden talents.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bizarre-chicken-act-is-not-a-hit-with-the-america-s-got-talent-judges>Bizarre Chicken Act is Not a Hit with the ‘America’s Got Talent’ Judges</h2><p>This bizarre chicken audition followed a slew of red buzzers and disappointing acts. The drummer who goes by the name of “Drumstick” has been passionate about playing the drums for his entire life. After graduating college, he joined the United States Marine Drum&nbsp;& Bugle Corps.</p><p>It is his dream job to play the drums and serve his country. For his odd audition, he was dressed as a fluffy chicken. Did anyone else get Sethward vibes from this audition? America’s Got Talent really doesn’t have room for two guys in animal costumes this season.</p><p>When asked if his fellow Marines approve of his act, Drumstick was very hot and cold. Sometimes they encourage him. For his big America’s Got Talent audition, Drumstick performed a drum solo with some chicken accompaniments. Yes, it is as wild as it sounds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“You think there is a gap in the market for what you’re doing now?” Simon Cowell asked.</p><p>Drumstick literally had a drum set on one side along with a bunch of rubber chickens on the other side. The rubber chickens made some seriously squeaky noises whenever he hit them with the drumsticks. The judges were not at all impressed with his act. They hit their red buzzers one by one.</p><p>Sofia Vergara pointed out that this is an act that would be good at children’s parties. Unfortunately, it definitely is not up to par with some of the other acts that we have seen so far in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16</a>. Drumstick still kept a good attitude even after the judges roasted his act.</p><p>“I do tend to pick up a lot of chicks like this,” Drumstick hilariously said.</p><p>He also found a huge fan in Terry Crews backstage. Even if the judges don’t like an act, Crews is the perfect hype man. He paid him the ultimate compliment after a disappointing onstage experience.</p><p>“I think you’re the hottest chicken that’s not on a sandwich,” Crews told Drumstick backstage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AGT-Scarlett-Business.jpeg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Auditions Continue with Some Unique Acts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x66kmqZdmLWqr8qepWaflanAbq7Us7GenF2ks6d5zp9kraCVYq6usdGimpqrXZy8tXnTmqOepqRiwLWtxp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apres-le-vote-des-deputes-des-reactions-contrastees-chez-les-associations-delus-locaux.html><span>←</span><span>Aprs le vote des dputs, des ractions contrastes chez les associations d'lus locaux</span></a>
