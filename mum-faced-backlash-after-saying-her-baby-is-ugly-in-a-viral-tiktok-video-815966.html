However, the story didn’t stop there; when she playfully posted her daughter in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TikTok challenge, she encountered a&nbsp;storm of&nbsp;criticism, which Lucy defied with her steadfast maternal affection.</p><p><h2>Getting pregnant with Reese had its fair share of&nbsp;ups and downs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b1/6cc/44d72a5e0f9db6667aa8de739e.jpg><p>Lucy Baehr shared an&nbsp;experience that resonated with many mothers who eagerly anticipate the arrival of&nbsp;their newborn babies, expecting them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;undeniably cute. Hailing from Arkansas, her story took an&nbsp;unusual and humorous twist, capturing the online world’s attention.</p><p>Lucy’s journey to&nbsp;motherhood was a&nbsp;real rollercoaster. She’d faced the formidable challenge of&nbsp;infertility and experienced heartbreaking losses. But she was a&nbsp;loving mom to&nbsp;her daughter, Harper, and a&nbsp;dedicated stepmom to&nbsp;Cole. In&nbsp;September <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2019</a>, they added a&nbsp;third furry member to&nbsp;the family, a&nbsp;dog, hoping to&nbsp;fill that void in&nbsp;their lives.</p><p>Then, in&nbsp;February 2020, she dropped a&nbsp;bombshell: Lucy found out she was pregnant with a&nbsp;baby girl. The news left her overjoyed and, well, a&nbsp;little incredulous. When her daughter, Reese, finally arrived, Lucy’s first reaction was a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;shock and humor.</p><p>She recalls the moment, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I’m pretty sure&nbsp;I looked at&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and was like, ’She’s healthy?’” It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;perfect way to&nbsp;sum up&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise that life had thrown her way, making Reese’s arrival a&nbsp;bit less unique than they had anticipated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb4/3bb/7a9e4f591f8bb815561ecbb4df.jpg><p>“Her nose was incredibly swollen, and her eyes were beady.” The new mom also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> how looking back, not a&nbsp;single person, not even the delivery room nurses, tried to&nbsp;sugarcoat that Reese wasn’t exactly a&nbsp;poster baby for cuteness.</p><p>“People just didn’t comment on&nbsp;her appearance,” she laughed.</p><p>When Harper, Reese’s sister, got to&nbsp;hold her baby sibling for the first time, even she couldn’t help but notice the striking differences between them. While Baehr’s daughter was likely excited about becoming an&nbsp;older sibling, she couldn’t help but steal a&nbsp;glance at&nbsp;her mother and make a&nbsp;candid observation about Reese’s appearance, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weird.”</a> Lucy, her mother, reassured Harper, telling her there was some truth to&nbsp;her observation.</p><p><h2>The “ugly baby” Tiktok challenge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/09c/d57/db6fba5d78b280a9aed0c76be0.jpg><p>Most people know it’s almost taboo for mothers to&nbsp;admit their children might not be&nbsp;the cutest openly. Still, Lucy Baehr fearlessly ventured into that territory using TikTok. She joined in&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trend where people shared their experiences of&nbsp;expecting an&nbsp;adorable newborn but being surprised by&nbsp;reality. With a&nbsp;good-natured laugh, the mother of&nbsp;three proudly declared that she had taken the crown in&nbsp;that department!</p><p>When Baehr caught the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trend</a> of&nbsp;folks sharing photos of&nbsp;their “less-than-cute babies” on&nbsp;TikTok, she couldn’t resist jumping on&nbsp;the bandwagon. At&nbsp;one point, her video had been seen by&nbsp;almost <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>24&nbsp;million people</a>. It&nbsp;all turned into a&nbsp;big laugh, with some users jokingly suggesting that her daughter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> like <i>Mr. Bean</i> or&nbsp;<i><a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a>’s </i>Dobby!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/636/130/05396d50488c073ce7975497d4.jpg><p>Most of&nbsp;the comments from her TikTok followers were all in&nbsp;good fun. One person even quipped that Reese <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> “like a&nbsp;villager.”</p><p>Another person playfully guessed that the little girl definitely took after her father. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Someone</a> else couldn’t help but sympathize with the idea that women endure nine months of&nbsp;nausea and drama, only for their kids to&nbsp;come out “looking like their dads.” Another added, “Newborns are rarely, if&nbsp;ever, cute. They’re a ‘trust the process’ kinda creature.”</p><p>However, while many on&nbsp;social media found Baehr’s post to&nbsp;be&nbsp;light-hearted fun, some didn’t share the sentiment. Some believed poking fun at&nbsp;a&nbsp;child was in&nbsp;bad taste and sharing such a&nbsp;clip on&nbsp;social media wasn’t right.</p><p><h2>The new mom got a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;heat for poking fun at&nbsp;her baby</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/319/47a/292f4b5789a8f946ffbd08e196.jpg><p>Baehr opened up&nbsp;about the criticism she faced, with some people labeling her a&nbsp;“terrible mom.” Critics were concerned that her viral post might negatively impact Reese’s self-esteem. However, Baehr stood her ground, explaining that she was simply being honest.</p><p>The mother of&nbsp;three clarified that she intended to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>normalize</a> the reality of&nbsp;how newborns often looked when they entered the world. She reassured everyone that Reese was perfectly fine. Baehr even pledged to&nbsp;share the story with Reese one day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4f/d0d/1190d355209b0ceb847a98bfd6.jpg><p>She also believed that her daughter would inherit her sense of&nbsp;humor. Her primary aim was to&nbsp;remind mothers that not all newborns fit the typical “perfect-looking” image, and that’s perfectly okay. She emphasized that her video wasn’t meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mean-spirited, and she knew Reese wasn’t ugly.</p><p>Lucy also shared an&nbsp;Instagram picture of&nbsp;her newborn baby, adding a&nbsp;heartfelt caption explaining the significance of&nbsp;Reese’s name. She deeply loved the little girl, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “You were loved long before you got here.”</p><p><h2>The glow-up is&nbsp;real</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c1/ee9/1e97bf5026921d86a1ccd243b2.jpg><p>But as&nbsp;a&nbsp;respectable princess, Reese has grown into a&nbsp;beautiful baby. Her mom finally gave her Instagram followers a&nbsp;peek at&nbsp;Reese almost three years after her birth, sharing more photos and even a&nbsp;video clip showcasing how pretty and lively her daughter had become. People in&nbsp;the comments couldn’t help but gush, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calling</a> Reese a&nbsp;“beautiful baby girl,” “absolutely precious,” and “a&nbsp;doll.”</p><p>Then, on&nbsp;November&nbsp;4,<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> 2022,</a> Baehr dropped an&nbsp;Instagram video that captured how Reese had changed over the years. She revealed that it&nbsp;took her two years to&nbsp;put the clip together and that it&nbsp;had her feeling a&nbsp;bit emotional. The video showed Reese laughing, smiling, learning to&nbsp;crawl, playing with the family dog, taking her first steps, feeding herself, exploring the world, and transforming into the gorgeous little girl she is&nbsp;now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/233/67d2635195be63e3dc5876d488.jpg><p>Things have been looking up&nbsp;for Reese, who’s now nearly three years old. “Reese is&nbsp;gorgeous,” Baehr proudly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “She has these huge blue eyes.”</p><p>However, Reese’s journey reminds&nbsp;us that beauty truly comes in&nbsp;all shapes and sizes. Her heartwarming transformation and her radiant spirit teach&nbsp;us to&nbsp;embrace our unique selves and appreciate the beauty in&nbsp;every child, no&nbsp;matter how they may look at&nbsp;birth.</p><p>Stories like this might sound strange, but they’re pretty common. Just see what other folks shared about their <a href=#>first</a> encounters with their babies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq2uYyfmJydlGKvoq%2FKpZisoF2Ws7Wx0WaqmrGZo7RutMSrZJuZkq56qr%2BMrp6lsV2eu26tjK%2Bgq5mcYsGqt9OoomaumZmysHmXamxybmZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-elus-satisfaits-de-loffre-de-meubles-touristiques-mais-mecontents-de-la-taxe-de-sejour.html><span>←</span><span>Les lus satisfaits de l'offre de meubls touristiques, mais mcontents de la taxe de sjour</span></a>
