Environmental sound artist Cheryl Beer uses hearing aid and biomedical technology to record moisture moving through the vascular systems of Celtic Rainforest trees. She weaves this data into musical compositions. In 2021, while recording a young oak tree in <a href=#>Coed Cwm Elan (Elan Valley Woodlands)</a>, she felt it was responding to the birds singing nearby. 'Slowly, more and more birds joined in, and the tree’s biorhythms began to change, becoming more tuneful and melodic. It was akin to a duet between a tree and the birds', she says.</p><p>In prehistoric times, when Wales a richly forested nation, Celtic Rainforests were used sustainably for timber and livestock. More recently, overgrazing, and the spread of invasive species have taken their toll, causing many temperate rainforests to shrink or vanish. Through the Celtic Rainforests Wales restoration project, launched in 2019 with funding from Natura 2000 and the EU LIFE scheme, Welsh environmental organisations are seeking remedies. They’re focusing on planting trees, removing non-native plants such as rhododendrons and allowing small herds of cattle to keep brambles and ivy at bay.</p><p>In future generations, Wales may well boast a great green corridor of trees. That’s the ambition of the Welsh Government’s long-term programme, <a href=#>The National Forest for Wales</a>, announced in 2020. 'The National Forest for Wales is a ground-breaking, world-first initiative that will connect both state and private woodlands, creating a network of well managed and good quality woodlands containing trails running the length and breadth of Wales', says programme head Erika Dawson-Davies.</p><p>Blessed with rare species, Celtic Rainforests could perhaps play a crucial role in the National Forest for Wales. 'Helping restore and maintain some of Wales’ irreplaceable ancient woodlands is among our aims', says Erika.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifLe10qKraKaRqcKzsYylmKeco5iusbHSaKmerpmprq210qKloGWnmrm0tIycnKWsmZh6s63Ip52oqpWowbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1409274-lana-rhoades-biography-age-real-net-worth-partner-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lana Rhoades' biography: all we know about her child and baby daddy</span></a>
