With his diversified career path, it’s not impossible for him to excel on the dancing competition series. Let’s get to know him more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barry-williams-enjoys-a-multifaceted-celebrity-career>Barry Williams Enjoys a Multifaceted Celebrity Career</h2><p>Hailing from Southern California, Williams kicked off his career as an 11-year-old, exploring acting and music alongside other young artists. His decades-long entertainment career began with his debut role in Run For Your Life.</p><p>During the 1970s, American sitcom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Brady Bunch</a> premiered, introducing Williams as Greg Brady, the iconic eldest son of the family. Since then, he’s enjoyed unprecedented success in the industry.</p><p>He appeared in several TV series, ventured into musical theater, and wrote a bestselling autobiography titled Growing Up Brady: I Was A Teenage Greg. Over the years, he’s almost never been idle in the entertainment scene. This year, he’s choosing not to be inactive as well. The Here Come the Brides star is joining season 32 of the ABC dancing reality series, Dancing With The Stars.</p><p>“It’s official! I will be dancing my way into your hearts on #DWTS,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Williams will be showing his grooves with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peta Murgatroyd</a> as his dance partner. On Instagram, Murgatroyd welcomed him, calling him an “absolute gem.” Promising to bring the fun this season, Williams is definitely a contestant to look out for in the coming months.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-plans-to-show-off-some-brady-bunch-moves-on-dwts>He Plans to Show Off Some Brady Bunch Moves on DWTS</h2><p>Intending to pay tribute to his TV roots, Williams is also channeling his inner Greg Brady on the dance floor. During the season’s cast announcement on Good Morning America, the actor told fans that his Brady Bunch origins will peak through in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> journey.</p><p>“I want to incorporate all the Brady Bunch dance moves,” he said. “That includes the marking time, that includes the shuffle, the turn-around-and-spin and, of course, up-and-downs.”</p><p>“In other words, it’s not much!” Murgatroyd jokingly stated.</p><p>For those who may not know, the Sept. 26 premiere of DWTS is also the 54th anniversary of The Brady Bunch‘s first episode. According to Williams, the night will be “very special.”</p><p>In an interview with The Messenger, their pair admitted that they are also planning to honor Florence Henderson who played Williams mom in the sitcom.</p><p>“Barry was extremely close with her,” Murgatroyd <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>said</a>. “He’s teared up a couple of times talking about her. So yeah, I think there’s definitely going to be a week — or maybe Week 1 — where we can pay homage to her for sure. She was a beautiful person.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_JohnLegend_ChrissyTiegen_Paul-MorigiGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="John Legend, Chrissy Teigen Renew Vows on 10th Wedding Anniversary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYrG4wNJmmp6klZe%2FqsDYZpmaqqKueri1y6WgmqWjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1543329-what-gyatt-a-popular-tiktok-slang-term-explained.html><span>←</span><span>What does GYATT mean?
