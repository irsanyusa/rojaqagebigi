Electrolytes! Potassium! A natural hangover cure! But it also sets 4/5 experts’ eyes a’rolling.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’d rather spend my money on natural foods and not an expensive, over-hyped fluid,” says <strong>Nancy Clark</strong>, a registered dietitian and sports nutrition counselor. “It is a good source of potassium, but so are bananas and potatoes. ”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In fact, manufacturers do love to claim that coconut water packs as much potassium as a whole banana. It also has as much sugar as a banana—even an unsweetened version can run you 15 grams of sugar per bottle. But it packs none of the fiber the fruit does.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Coconut water is famous for nutritional posturing. <strong>Tod Cooperman</strong>, MD, president of the independent tester of health products ConsumerLab.com, conducted a <a href=# rel=noopener>study</a> on coconut water in 2011. Most of the products it tested failed to meet their mineral claims and came up short on sodium and magnesium—two of coconut water’s heralded electrolytes. “While it’s certainly safe to drink coconut water, it’s been overhyped and even mislabeled,” Cooperman says. “If you plan on using it for mild hydration, it’s fine. But if you are doing prolonged physical exercise, you are losing sodium (not potassium) in your sweat, and coconut water is not a good source of sodium.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The findings were used in a <a href=# rel=noopener>class-action lawsuit</a> against Vita Coco in 2012 for exaggerating its nutritional claims with words like “super hydrating,” “nutrient-packed” and “mega-electrolyte.” The company agreed to a $10 million settlement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even so, the health halo of cocoH2O hasn’t gone away. Though it’s healthier than a regular neon-colored sports drink and does pack an impressive amount of potassium, “drinking one to two boxes of coconut water a day could lead to an increased intake of 60 to 120 calories a day, more for flavored waters or larger sizes, which adds up, particularly if one is trying to lose weight,” says <strong>Maya Rao</strong>, MD, a nephrologist at Columbia University. Both she and <strong>Jennifer Koslo</strong>, PhD, a registered dietitian and specialist in sports dietetics, recommend plain, boring, unhyped water for the average person. A 2012 <a href=# rel=noopener>study</a>—which Vita Coco funded—found little difference in the hydration or performance of men after they worked out and drank bottled water, coconut water or a sports drink.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But before you totally cast aside the tropical fruit juice, <strong>Kristin Kirkpatrick</strong>, registered dietitian and manager of wellness nutrition services at Cleveland Clinic’s Wellness Institute, rushed to the liquid darling’s defense. If you’re looking for a break from regular water, it’s a much better choice than a sports drink loaded with excessive sugar, she says. And athletes aren’t the only ones who could use some extra potassium: “Individuals that may be struggling to get enough fruits and vegetables (major sources of potassium) in their diets” can benefit as well, she says. “Potassium may help to ward off stroke and early death in women, according to a 2014 <a href=# rel=noopener>study</a> in the journal Stroke, and decreased potassium levels may be <a href=# rel=noopener>linked</a> to a higher incidence of blood pressure.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So should you drink coconut water? If you like your bananas unpeeled, de-fibered and super-expensive, this drink is for you. But free and boring water, plus a cheap piece of fruit, appears to work just as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read next: <a href=# rel=noopener>Should I Eat Cheese?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbWVug3N9jpymnKeeqsFuw8CtnKtlnqrBs7XToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-your-charger-cable-turned-green-toss-it-asap-814147.html><span>←</span><span>If Your Charger Cable Turned Green, Toss It ASAP</span></a>
