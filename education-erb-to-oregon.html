Two years ago Dr. Frederick Maurice Hunter was brought from Denver as Oregon’s Chancellor of Higher Education to quiet a raging political dogfight. But the University still feels itself the underdog.

He was a professor of economics at Oregon for six years, in the last year had been acting head of the economics department at Stanford University.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sandy-haired Donald Erb, a keen football fan, golfer and fisherman, last week made a diplomatic beginning.
