 Dear reader,  That your boyfriend has made you angry does not disqualify him from the position of your first listening ears when you need to settle that issue."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

What should I do?</strong>________________</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Dear reader,</p><p>That your boyfriend has made you angry does not disqualify him from the position of your first listening ears when you need to settle that issue. So in this case, I’d ask, have you explained to him how insensitive those words were and how hurt you were by them? Did you bother to have a talk with him about how such words put you down and make a mockery of all the hard work you are putting into becoming a better person? If the answer to these is no, then I really think you can do better.</p><p>As we have explained in <a href=# id=28324022-7533-5682-b9d9-e867fd680557>this very educative and helpful article here</a>, talking to outsiders is OK but it should come after you have extensively communicated with your partner, not before. It is when all the efforts at communication bears no good fruit that you can now extend your search for answers to outsiders. By outsiders, I mean every single person other than you and your beau.</p><p>Let me also add that I don’t think this is an issue that should split your relationship apart. It’s not much of an issue, sincerely, if you can communicate with him in clear terms <a href=# id=516b67d4-dbbf-5f17-a307-f2f982588168>how words like that affect your psyche</a> and makes you feel incompetent and undervalued and disrespected. Truth is, he may not even know the extent of the damage of such words. And this is why you have to forgo the expectation placed on him to know better, and actually explain to him expressly what can’t be joked with and words that do not help you in any way.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is only when this pattern of insults and harsh criticism continues that you may now start to consider dumping him for good. I really do hope, though, that it doesn’t come to that._________________</p><p><strong>Do you want to talk about your love life, marriage or family issues?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you have burning questions that you would love to get answers to?</strong></p><p><strong>Note; the chances of getting a quick response reduces if the text in your email has a lot of abbreviations.
