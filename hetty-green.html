She was one of the richest women in the world during her lifetime and is often cited as one of the greatest female investors in history.</p><p>Green's business acumen was evident from an early age. When she inherited a large fortune from her family, she astutely managed her investments in real estate, railroads, and government bonds, significantly increasing her wealth. Her financial prowess was exceptional at a time when women were not commonly involved in high-level financial decisions.</p><p>Despite her wealth, Green lived a life of extreme thriftiness. She was famous for her refusal to spend money on even basic necessities and her efforts to avoid paying taxes. These habits, coupled with her stern demeanor and all-black attire, contributed to her reputation as a miser and earned her the moniker "the Witch of Wall Street."</p><p>Green's life was also marked by several legal disputes, mostly related to her family's inheritance. Her unwillingness to spend money on her family's health care reportedly led to her son losing his leg due to an untreated injury, further cementing her reputation for frugality.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>November 21</a>, <a href=#>1834</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> New Bedford, Massachusetts, USA<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Scorpio</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 3</a>, <a href=#>1916</a> (aged 81)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Apoplexy after she argued with a maid over the virtues of skimmed milk.
