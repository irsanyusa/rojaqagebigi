The age they are supposed to&nbsp;look without ridiculous procedures and filters.

She’s natural, not pumped full of&nbsp;plastic,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commends</a> a&nbsp;voice applauding Kate for resisting the siren call of&nbsp;artificial enhancements. This defender celebrates the Duchess’s refusal to&nbsp;succumb to&nbsp;societal pressures that often lead others down the path of&nbsp;cosmetic alterations.</p><p>In&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;the storm, a&nbsp;compassionate defender <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offers</a>, “I&nbsp;think she looks terrific. She’s at&nbsp;a&nbsp;sad event.” This acknowledgment of&nbsp;the emotional context provides a&nbsp;humane perspective, recognizing that a&nbsp;moment captured on&nbsp;film may not encapsulate the entirety of&nbsp;the human experience.</p><p><h2>The critics were harsh.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f59/1bc/7dec2751d6abaf4f744e5cf2a7.jpg><p>Yet, the critics wield their own lens, one that often magnifies “flaws”. “Must say...

She needs a&nbsp;good skin routine,” said <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>another</a>, underscoring society’s relentless pursuit of&nbsp;flawlessness and its expectation that women adhere to&nbsp;stringent beauty regimens.</p><p>The harshest critique <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assumes</a>, “She is&nbsp;obviously very unhappy.” This snap judgment based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;single frame serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stark reminder of&nbsp;the dangers of&nbsp;assuming emotional states based on&nbsp;curated glimpses into a&nbsp;person’s life.</p><p><h2>This is&nbsp;not the first time the princess gets age-shamed.</h2></p><p>This is&nbsp;not the first time Kate Middleton has been targeted by&nbsp;trolls regarding her appearance. In&nbsp;the past, she has been subjected to&nbsp;derogatory comments about her aging and physical appearance, with some trolls even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dubbing</a> her “Kate Wrinkleton”. However, Middleton’s fans have consistently rushed to&nbsp;her defense, condemning the online mockery and emphasizing the need to&nbsp;appreciate natural aging as&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard of&nbsp;beauty.</p><p><h2>Happily, there’s a&nbsp;shift in&nbsp;the way we&nbsp;tackle aging.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8a/fc5/92da245995ba86d8eec46bd5c6.jpg><p>GEORGE ROGERS/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p>The public’s response to&nbsp;the trolls’ criticism highlights a&nbsp;broader societal conversation about beauty standards, ageism, and the treatment of&nbsp;public figures. It&nbsp;underscores the importance of&nbsp;challenging unrealistic beauty ideals and embracing natural aging as&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;life.</p><p>The support for Kate Middleton in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;online mockery reflects a&nbsp;positive shift in&nbsp;societal attitudes toward aging and beauty standards. It&nbsp;serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that individuals, regardless of&nbsp;their status, should be&nbsp;celebrated for aging gracefully and naturally, free from the pressures of&nbsp;unrealistic beauty expectations.</p><p>The ageist commentary seems relentless.
