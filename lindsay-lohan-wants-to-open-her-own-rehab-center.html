She is so public that I think we can only be positive and look to the future to help other families.”</p><p>Which is a noble route to go, though would-be patients might be skeptical about the fact that Lohan has been in rehab five times in the last three years, which doesn’t really inspire a lot of confidence in her recovery advice.
