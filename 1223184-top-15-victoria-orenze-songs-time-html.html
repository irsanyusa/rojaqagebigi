I Want To See You</h3><p></p><p class=align-left><i>“The prayer. That I may know him.”</i> The artiste wrote these words as a description under the YouTube video of I Want To See You song. And this track really sounds like a sincere prayer coming from the innermost corners of her soul. It is her true wish to know God, to know His ways, and to live her life serving the ideals of Christianity. All people who have faith in the Lord share Orenze’s desire. Maybe, this is the reason Victoria Orenze I Want To See You became so popular among her fans. The comments from YouTube is proof of that:</p>Is it me or is this song piercing...I can not function without worship! - @Nelson AsohChai I love you Victoria.......

Brooding</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Victoria Orenze Brooding is a powerful and emotional gospel that implores God and Holy Spirit to “purify our passion” and “take away our weakness.” It is a song about our belief that the Lord is almighty and can do anything:</p>You are brooding / Over every darkness / You are causing / Light to shine from darkness<p class=align-left>If your faith is strong, nothing is impossible. The Lord will save you from anything and will give you strength when you need it the most. You just have to believe. As one of the YouTube users duly pointed out, it is:</p>A song that ushers one into the realms of the spirit shattering every barrier of darkness. -@onyeka dicksom<h3>6. Invade Me</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>When you are feeling down, when nothing seems right, and you are dreaming about some kind of reboot, you should listen to this gospel. Victoria Orenze Invade Me is a worship song that will revive your soul and lift your burdens. It calls for the Holy Spirit to “invade us” and “renew us,” in other words, to give us the strength to move on and meet the new day with a smile on our faces.</p><p class=align-left>More importantly, this prayer reaches the hearts of the listeners, and they begin to pray together with Victoria Orenze.

I Thirst for You</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>In this track, the singer preaches about the need we have for God. She teaches us that we have to seek the Lord every single day of our lives. The Almighty gives his blessings each day, and you cannot transfer the gift from yesterday to today or tomorrow. Today, you need to ask for a new blessing by looking for God. “He wants You to long for Him daily” she sings. And as a true preacher, she finds the hearts that need these particular words:</p>Wow! This song spoke to me differently. I’ve been struggling with this particular issue of not being consistent with my worship. I’m just here being complacent with my relationship with God. Oh Father! please give me the strength to keep going no matter what!!!! - @Carl Sackey<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best Tye Tribbett songs and albums</p><h3>8. Emi Mimo</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Emi Mimo is another gospel by Orenze, in which she proclaims our need for the Lord. This track calls for God to give us strength and reassurance, to “come and help us do the things we are unwilling to do.” This song is especially helpful for those facing a difficult decision or for those who lack might or spirit to act. We all find ourselves in such situations during our lives. Therefore, this prayer is relevant to everyone. Comments on YouTube is good proof of that:</p>This woman eish, even if you don't understand the language but she brings the presence of God to your doorstep, an amazing worshipper, continue being a vessel of honor - @Tafadzwa MushangweMy God...! Depth of worship, sound of heaven!! - @Tidimalo MokhokhoWow, I can feel the anointing of God as I am watching right now.

We Bow Down</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>We Bow Down is a song of worship that praises the Lord. The repeating words <i>“We bow down Lord / and with the Angels, we cry Ho-ly”</i> sung by Victoria Orenze with the emotion only she can produce steadily put you in the state of a religious trance. You let these words run through yourself and feel how your soul is being revived. The talent of this woman is truly unique.</p><h3>10. The Presence</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>The Presence is a true gospel song that reaches the souls of people. The track reminds us that God is always beside us. He always listens to us when we pray and praise Him. Therefore, we should never lose our faith and seek God with our prayers every day.</p><h3>11. Only The Living</h3><p></p>Only the Living Can Praise You / Only the Living Can Worship / I am alive so I Praise You / I am alive so I worship<p class=align-left>These words that are repeated continuously throughout the song reflect the main idea of the track perfectly. If you are alive, you should worship God. Every living being on this planet should praise Him. Only The Living is a simple song that conveys deep ideas. This makes the track even more fascinating.</p><h3>12. My Redeemer</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>It is one of the songs by Victoria Orenze that praises the Lord the most. The singer says that she is ready to sacrifice all that she has for God: her time, worship, devotion, attention. And this sacrifice is not a big deal because the Lord is our saviour, redeemer, sustainer, and helper. We should give everything to Him and praise Him every waking hour.</p><h3>13. Holy</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Holy is a very sincere song that praises God. We all have moments when our faith dwindles due to various reasons. In such times, we might think that the Lord is responsible for our downfalls and that there is no use in worshipping Him anymore. However, the track claims that the Lord is always worthy of our worship. Victoria Orenze sings that He always deserves it <i>“even when I don’t feel like it […] even when I am not up to it.”</i> Thus, we should always praise our Lord, no matter how we feel about it at the moment.</p><h3>14. I Proclaim You</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>This emotional track proclaims God the only king over everything in this world. It states that the Lord is our only master and helper, and all of us should praise and love Him.</p><h3>15. Great And Mighty</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>Great And Mighty song by Victoria Orenze touches every heart and soul that it reaches. This powerful track is full of praising the Lord. It names God “Great and Mighty” and states that He is “full of wonders, power, and wisdom.” Nothing could be so true. The Lord is worth of every our praise and worship. He deserves our love because he loves us even more. All YouTube users agree with this:</p>Great and mighty are You Lord....Awesome God. Almighty God. Faithful God. Loving God. Great and mighty are You. - @Julia Oku JacksVery inspiring song unto the Lord. It's blessing to me. - @David AkpenaThank you Sis for this Song. Always lifted by your songs. Always heaven inspired.
