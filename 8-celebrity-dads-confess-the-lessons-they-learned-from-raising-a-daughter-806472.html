And even though it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;tricky and confusing as&nbsp;the father himself has never experienced life from a&nbsp;female perspective, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;admit that it’s always fascinating to&nbsp;see how protective dads can get over their girls and how much these little women can transform them in&nbsp;surprising ways.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> thinks that the special bond between a&nbsp;father and his daughter is&nbsp;a&nbsp;treasure that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;celebrated. Here are some famous dads who open up&nbsp;about the gift of&nbsp;being called a ’’girl dad.’’</p><p><h2>1. Will Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/083/1e2/89e0d6523bbc7a92b524d5d512.jpg><p>Growing up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;strict dad, the <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>star</a> was used to&nbsp;the idea that success could only be&nbsp;achieved with extreme <a href=# title=discipline data-link=tag>discipline</a> and hard work. And when his only daughter, Willow, decided to&nbsp;stop her ongoing music tour, Will was furious, and the father-daughter duo had a&nbsp;big argument, and as&nbsp;an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;protest, Willow shaved her head. This was a&nbsp;wake-up call for Will, who realized that being that strict with his kids would only push them away. The actor confessed, ’’I had a&nbsp;real epiphany on&nbsp;that and how bad a&nbsp;person will hate you if&nbsp;you keep forcing your wishes onto their life.’’</p><p><h2>2. Dwayne Johnson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2e/ff0/464c88558cb07315e15769d2fa.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Rock</a> couldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;more proud dad of&nbsp;3&nbsp;girls. On&nbsp;Father’s Day, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> on&nbsp;his social media page, ’’Every man wants a&nbsp;son, but every man needs a&nbsp;daughter.’’ He&nbsp;went&nbsp;on, saying, ’’All my&nbsp;girls have become the great equalizers in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.’’</p><p>The Hollywood superstar never loses a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;express his <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for his daughters. And on&nbsp;his second daughter’s fourth birthday, he&nbsp;had these sweet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>words</a> to&nbsp;say: ’’You have my&nbsp;word, I’ll love and take care of&nbsp;you for the rest of&nbsp;mine.’’</p><p><h2>3. Mark Wahlberg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/331/9a7/90bcef5ea5b0347e7819d86a0e.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the 50-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a>, what first comes to&nbsp;mind are his action roles and tough persona. But it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seems</a> that at&nbsp;home, Mark is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tender-hearted “girl dad,” who will even sit through a&nbsp;pampering session while his youngest 12-year-old daughter does his nails.</p><p><h2>4. Tim McGraw</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27d/50e/c1d55d5c01bec61516a9ede0d3.jpg><p>The country music <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>superstar</a> is&nbsp;the ultimate “girl dad,” having 3&nbsp;daughters and no&nbsp;sons, and it&nbsp;seems that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;very happy about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The singer has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house full of&nbsp;women, saying ’’They have made me&nbsp;such a&nbsp;better man. They made me&nbsp;see things in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way. They taught me&nbsp;so&nbsp;much more about life, about how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;man."</p><p><h2>5. Jamie Foxx</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/071/dfc/f074305fe7abb99dd3fc3a5134.jpg><p>The 54-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> has raised his 2&nbsp;daughters as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single parent, and he&nbsp;confessed that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;better dad with time. One of&nbsp;the main lessons he&nbsp;learned was to&nbsp;put his girls first and be&nbsp;there for them all the time. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for his absence with money and material things. But having his older daughter once say to&nbsp;him, ’’I don’t like you,’’ and ’’Show up&nbsp;and be&nbsp;there when you say you’re going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there,’’ was a&nbsp;big eye-opener for Jamie.</p><p><h2>6. Thomas Rhett</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c3/bf9/eb44a158e899c29aa29817eb20.jpg><p>The country music <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>singer</a> and songwriter has 4&nbsp;daughters, the oldest of&nbsp;whom is&nbsp;adopted. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that his girls melt his heart every day. He&nbsp;then added, ’’There’s something about being a ’girl dad’ that&nbsp;I think has softened my&nbsp;heart, made me&nbsp;more patient even."</p><p><h2>7. Jimmy Fallon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f5/92c/f0fb775c07bd7170ed060ee401.jpg><p>The television <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>host</a> and <a href=# title=comedian data-link=tag>comedian</a> is&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;2&nbsp;girls, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;evident that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;huge soft spot for them. He&nbsp;has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, ’’Even the manliest guys will become softies when they have daughters.’’ He&nbsp;continued, ’’Dads immediately fall in&nbsp;love with their little girls and will let them get away with everything. So&nbsp;moms are going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the disciplinarians when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;daughters."</p><p><h2>8. Chris Hemsworth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bf/ccc/0af140518a8376bf5175f5fa1c.jpg><p>The Australian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> is&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;twin boys and a&nbsp;daughter, India. India was his firstborn, and he&nbsp;has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about parenthood, saying, ’’It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever been a&nbsp;part of.’’ The Hollywood star added that his daughter is&nbsp;the main focus in&nbsp;his life, saying, ’’When I&nbsp;am at&nbsp;work, she’s what I’m thinking about, and when I’m not at&nbsp;work, she’s who I’m hanging out with!"</p><p>Do&nbsp;you believe that there is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;special kind of&nbsp;connection between a&nbsp;dad and his daughter?
