The woman’s world has been shattered after she discovered her husband’s double life which she had no&nbsp;idea about during 15&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. The trigger for this painful revelation was an&nbsp;ordinary high-school photo album that Theresa found in&nbsp;her husband’s belongings. Now, the woman wishes she had never even touched this album, but it’s too late and now the desperate wife and mom doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the truth that has been opened to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>Theresa penned&nbsp;us a&nbsp;very emotional letter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b6/50a/9e7b7159f0b3417aea5c72d077.jpg><p>Theresa, 37, used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;happily married woman, who was living her best life with her beloved husband Tim, and her 2&nbsp;wonderful kids. The woman penned&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and shared her story which provoked quite a&nbsp;stir in&nbsp;our editorial. We&nbsp;imagined ourselves in&nbsp;her shoes for a&nbsp;moment and many of&nbsp;us confessed that we&nbsp;would feel desperate in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;complicated situation.</p><p>The woman wanted advice and opinions from our readers who might have faced a&nbsp;similar situation in&nbsp;their life and were able to&nbsp;recover from such a&nbsp;painful and devastating experience.</p><p>Theresa opened her letter, saying, “My&nbsp;husband Tim and&nbsp;I have been happily married for 15&nbsp;years. I&nbsp;met Tim at&nbsp;a&nbsp;big party that our mutual friend threw on&nbsp;the occasion of&nbsp;her birthday. We&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with each other instantly, this was a&nbsp;truly romantic and unforgettable beginning of&nbsp;our long and strong <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</p><p>Tim proposed to&nbsp;me&nbsp;after 5&nbsp;months of&nbsp;dating and&nbsp;I immediately said yes, because&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;sure that he&nbsp;was my&nbsp;only one and&nbsp;I saw no&nbsp;point in&nbsp;waiting, I&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;family with this man and&nbsp;I never regretted my&nbsp;decision, up&nbsp;until recently.”</p><p><h2>Theresa thought she knew everything about Tim, but she was mistaken.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/000/1d3/6cdd5255b48ab31d16bcc9ce64.jpg><p>Theresa shared, “There were no&nbsp;secrets between me&nbsp;and Tim from the very start of&nbsp;our relationship. Or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought. I&nbsp;shared every single detail of&nbsp;my&nbsp;past relationships with my&nbsp;husband, and so&nbsp;did&nbsp;he, and&nbsp;I was sure that&nbsp;I knew everything about his life. I&nbsp;was feeling secure and Tim was never tired of&nbsp;paying me&nbsp;the sweetest compliments about my&nbsp;appearance and personality, and he&nbsp;did it&nbsp;even after many years of&nbsp;our marriage. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;be&nbsp;jealous or&nbsp;anxious about anything, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;happy wife and a&nbsp;happy mother and everything seemed rock-solid, up&nbsp;until one day.”</p><p>The woman wrote, “Tim and&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the same bed when we&nbsp;got married, but when we&nbsp;had our first kid, and then the second in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;year, we&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger house and started sleeping in&nbsp;separate rooms. This only made our family happier, because we&nbsp;both had some <a href=# title="personal space" data-link=tag>personal space</a> and a&nbsp;higher quality of&nbsp;sleep, so&nbsp;yes, we&nbsp;both appreciated this detachment to&nbsp;some extent.</p><p>Tim used to&nbsp;clean his room on&nbsp;his own and&nbsp;I never really interfered with the ‘artistic mess’ that he&nbsp;had there. But once, when he&nbsp;was away on&nbsp;a&nbsp;long business trip, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;change the bedding in&nbsp;his room. I&nbsp;went there and started taking away the sheets when suddenly&nbsp;I noticed something resembling a&nbsp;book under his mattress. I&nbsp;took it&nbsp;out and saw that this was a&nbsp;photo album and all the photos there were taken while Tim was in&nbsp;the university. I’d never seen this album before, so&nbsp;I started looking through the photos with a&nbsp;genuine spark of&nbsp;curiosity.”</p><p><h2>Theresa made a&nbsp;shocking revelation while looking through her husband’s old album.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c38/e8f/a70ba754ce9d9613a739187b87.jpg><p>Theresa wrote, “I&nbsp;was shocked to&nbsp;discover that many photos showed Tim with some beautiful girl, apparently she was his groupmate, but their relationship was far from being just friendly. In&nbsp;every photo, Tim was hugging her and kissing her passionately. For&nbsp;me, this was a&nbsp;distressing discovery, because I’ve never heard of&nbsp;Tim having such a&nbsp;relationship in&nbsp;the past and he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that while being in&nbsp;the university he&nbsp;had zero relationship and dedicated all his time to&nbsp;studying for his degree.</p><p>I&nbsp;was just about to&nbsp;close this album and move on&nbsp;with the thought that my&nbsp;husband still had a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;hide the information about some of&nbsp;his past romantic experiences from me&nbsp;since this didn’t affect our relationship and marriage. And then&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;photo that made me&nbsp;freeze in&nbsp;shock. This was the photo of&nbsp;the same girl from the university, but it&nbsp;was taken recently, because there was a&nbsp;date on&nbsp;it, and the girl was looking a&nbsp;decade older, and she was holding a&nbsp;child. But the most heart-wrenching revelation was that the kid was a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband. And the kid did look like our younger son, who also looks like his dad 100%. I&nbsp;was speechless.”</p><p><h2>Theresa contacted the woman from the photo and revealed the devastating truth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/3b4/1e0c6251ddaffd9595f7fc908e.jpg><p>Theresa shared, “On&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;one photo, I&nbsp;saw the names of&nbsp;Tim’s groupmates written by&nbsp;him, together with their phone numbers. The woman’s name was also there and&nbsp;I found her phone number, too.</p><p>I&nbsp;called her and introduced myself, telling her that we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;talk. She wasn’t surprised at&nbsp;all as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she had been waiting for my&nbsp;call. We&nbsp;met in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small fast-food restaurant near our house and she started bombarding me&nbsp;with revelations soon after we&nbsp;said hello to&nbsp;one another.</p><p>Turned out, that Tim had been living a&nbsp;double life since the first day of&nbsp;our relationship. He&nbsp;was dating me&nbsp;and he&nbsp;never gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;dating her. Then he&nbsp;chose me&nbsp;for being his wife because this seemed a&nbsp;‘more practical decision’ since this woman thought she couldn’t have kids, but&nbsp;I was healthy and Tim chose me&nbsp;because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;maternal potential.</p><p>He&nbsp;had been going on&nbsp;his business trips, which weren’t business trips at&nbsp;all. He&nbsp;spent weeks in&nbsp;her house, with her, and then returned to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and imitated a&nbsp;happy family life. Then, against all expectations, she got pregnant and this was Tim’s son. And their relationship never faded, but only blossomed during all 15&nbsp;years that we&nbsp;were married.”</p><p>Theresa shared, “I&nbsp;haven’t spoken to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband yet. I&nbsp;asked that woman to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;the possibility to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;Tim first and she promised me&nbsp;that she would not tell him that&nbsp;I know everything. Now I’m sitting in&nbsp;the dark, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;room, and Tim is&nbsp;in&nbsp;his room, and I’m writing this letter to&nbsp;you because&nbsp;I don’t know how to&nbsp;act further and how to&nbsp;live further with this truth. And I&nbsp;don’t know how to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;Tim about this. What should I&nbsp;do?”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;woman, whose discovery was even more <a href=#>creepy</a> and distressing. She found a&nbsp;tampon in&nbsp;her husband’s car, and this hygienic stuff didn’t belong to&nbsp;her. The woman thought her husband was cheating and decided to&nbsp;conduct her investigation. Now she regrets her curiosity because the truth turned out even more disgusting than infidelity and the woman can’t come to&nbsp;terms with it&nbsp;now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuss6upZ1lna56qcHSm5innKNiwq%2B11Z6prKGkrnqxtM6tpmaZnJfCrnnAp5tmpZGZsm6tjJump51dmLWquMuipaBllJ7ApLvVnqmyZZGXvLbAjKGgpmVoZoZ1hZdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./14-celebs-whove-made-their-blended-families-work-beautifully-806830.html><span>←</span><span>14 Celebs Whove Made Their Blended Families Work Beautifully</span></a>
