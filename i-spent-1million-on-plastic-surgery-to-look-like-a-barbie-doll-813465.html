Her fascination with Barbies started in&nbsp;her early years when her grandfather bought her the dolls. Alves grew up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shy child</a>, and she often felt insecure about her looks. Later, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young adult, she decided to&nbsp;undergo plastic surgery to&nbsp;fix the issues she had with her body.</p><p><h2>By&nbsp;2018, she was dubbed a&nbsp;human Ken doll and had spent half a&nbsp;million on&nbsp;cosmetic procedures.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e28/7f9/7d6bb1512c97342f602ea130a3.jpg><p>Vandeville Eric/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>By&nbsp;age 35, Alves had undergone countless <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cosmetic treatments</a> that, according to&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV star, totaled over $500K. At&nbsp;that point, Alves still went by&nbsp;the name Rodrigo and her blonde hair and chiseled looks earned her the nickname ’human Ken doll’. She had spent thousands on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>procedures</a> known as ’cat eye lift’, several nose jobs, and figure enhancement surgeries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5c/f14/d90c5c50cb860c8c105d952831.jpg><p>AP/Associated Press/East News</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2020, Alves revealed that she was trans and went ahead to&nbsp;get gender reassignment surgery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/985/170/c46d40593bb929bc8afc989e75.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2020 Jessica Alves decided to&nbsp;come out to&nbsp;the world and revealed that she identified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> and would be&nbsp;undergoing gender reassignment surgery. “I’m known as&nbsp;Ken, but inside I’ve always felt like <a href=# title=Barbie data-link=tag>Barbie</a>. For years&nbsp;I tried to&nbsp;live my&nbsp;life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;fake six-pack put&nbsp;in, I&nbsp;had fake muscles in&nbsp;my&nbsp;arms, but&nbsp;I was lying to&nbsp;myself. I’m a&nbsp;woman and have always had a&nbsp;feminine brain. Now my&nbsp;body matches my&nbsp;mind,” Alves confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d7/6c5/874ca65f5299adef6e3d83bbdf.jpg><p><h2>Until now, Alves has spent a&nbsp;staggering $1&nbsp;million on&nbsp;plastic surgery but vows to&nbsp;stop going under the knife.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95a/8a3/3eba6d5947b3a94980bf64db5d.jpg><p>After announcing that she was transgender, Alves got additional body modifications to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;female-presenting body. She removed her <a href=# title=abs data-link=tag>abs</a> and donned a&nbsp;curvaceous figure, plump lips, and an&nbsp;even smaller nose. By&nbsp;2023, the total amount of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>money</a> she had spent on&nbsp;cosmetic treatments over the years went up&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;astonishing $1&nbsp;million.</p><p>However, it&nbsp;looks like Jessica Alves is&nbsp;finally content with her body, as&nbsp;she recently revealed she was “100% done with plastic surgery”. And went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;add: “I&nbsp;look amazing and feel amazing. I&nbsp;love being a&nbsp;woman, and&nbsp;I take pride in&nbsp;it. Growing&nbsp;up, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind, I&nbsp;had long hair and a&nbsp;voluptuous body shape, and today I&nbsp;am the woman of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33a/c67/e3edf25c8589758297dc896d57.jpg><p>Jessica Alves is&nbsp;far from the only influencer who went under the knife countless times.
