He&nbsp;meets the labradoodle of&nbsp;his dreams, and they start playing together. Peaceful tail wagging quickly grows into biting each other. Oh, no&nbsp;— they’re going for the necks. You grab Max and rush back home.</p><p>Well, in&nbsp;fact, there was no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;rush home. Playing with open mouths is&nbsp;called mouth-wrestling or&nbsp;jaw-sparring. It’s a&nbsp;healthy way of&nbsp;interaction between dogs. They inherited this habit from their wolf ancestors.</p><p>When a&nbsp;dog is&nbsp;a&nbsp;puppy, it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;learn some important skills including fighting. Mouthing is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;imitation of&nbsp;it. When a&nbsp;puppy matures, it&nbsp;will know how to&nbsp;protect itself and respect boundaries of&nbsp;other doggos. All the chasing, wrestling, growling, and face-biting is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;socialize with others and have fun in&nbsp;dog world. It’s something like sibling rivalry and playful fights in&nbsp;the human world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b5f/e99/85cfa35c288527669e4f443dfa.png><p>You can tell your dog is&nbsp;mouthing and not attacking another dog when it’s bouncing with happiness or&nbsp;lies down during the game. This way, it’s giving the playmate an&nbsp;advantage. They can also switch roles.</p><p>Now, some <a href=# title="dog breeds" data-link=tag>dog breeds</a> are less peaceful than others. A&nbsp;doggy can also feel afraid, territorial, or&nbsp;overprotective towards its human. In&nbsp;this case, jaw-sparring can grow into a&nbsp;real fight. When one dog loses the game spirit, bites too roughly, and holds down the rival for longer than it&nbsp;should, well, the poor playmate will start yelping. This can make the hunter and protector instincts in&nbsp;the other dog even sharper.</p><p>When the dog’s body stiffens, it&nbsp;stops bouncing and starts chasing, shows its teeth and gums&nbsp;— well, it’s time to&nbsp;stop that game. Things get even worse when you see the hackles on&nbsp;its back go&nbsp;up, and you hear some deep growling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1dd/f97/c501d855abb72712a173b38076.png><p>If&nbsp;your pet is&nbsp;often going too far with mouth-wrestling, you can consult a&nbsp;dog trainer to&nbsp;stop this. It’s also a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;teach it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;gentle with humans when it&nbsp;starts mouthing.</p><p>Let it&nbsp;play with your hands and yelp when it&nbsp;gets too much for your liking. The dog will startle for a&nbsp;moment and feel like it’s done something wrong. But that’s good! This is&nbsp;teaching your dog something called bite inhibition. You can also give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;toy or&nbsp;chew bone for a&nbsp;substitute when it&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;gnaw on&nbsp;you.</p><p>Cute kittens and cats under the age of&nbsp;2&nbsp;also practice mouthing. They often tumble over each other and bite one another’s necks to&nbsp;let out their hunter instincts. In&nbsp;the wild, cats are fast and merciless, and they can’t hide it&nbsp;behind all the purrs in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Play biting with other kitties can also teach your little Mister Biscuit to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more gentle when it&nbsp;plays with you and other humans, so&nbsp;it’s all good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/164/f3b/eb671e594e8f2d166c12fad960.jpg><p>Play sneezing is&nbsp;something many dogs&nbsp;do. It’s a&nbsp;sign they’re happy and enjoying the process. When they’re doing something fun, they often curl their lips. Their nose wrinkles then, and they sneeze. Such sneezes are always short as&nbsp;they come from the nose and not from the lungs.</p><p>Dogs tilt their heads when you call their name or&nbsp;make an&nbsp;unfamiliar sound to&nbsp;hear it&nbsp;better. They’re trying to&nbsp;adjust the outer ears to&nbsp;understand where the sound comes from. They can’t understand what you say, but they can catch a&nbsp;familiar tone and connect it&nbsp;with food, walk or&nbsp;play time.</p><p>They can also guess what you say from your face expression. Tilting the head helps them see better with less of&nbsp;their muzzle in&nbsp;the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3e4/828/6b32d85839b77118b0184e8e46.png><p>Now, cats often knock things off tables and bookshelves to&nbsp;express their prey drive. They’re natural hunters and explorers. The only way they can test a&nbsp;new object is&nbsp;patting, swatting, and knocking it&nbsp;down with their paws. Things that roll after falling make them playful. Once a&nbsp;cat notices you never ignore the sound of&nbsp;a&nbsp;falling something, it&nbsp;might start dropping things on&nbsp;purpose to&nbsp;get your attention.</p><p>Cats like to&nbsp;sharpen their claws on&nbsp;your <a href=# title=furniture data-link=tag>furniture</a> to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;visual mark on&nbsp;their territory. They also do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;let their claws renew and stretch their back and shoulders. The couch seems perfect for it&nbsp;because it’s not too short and is&nbsp;sturdy enough. Well, you gotta find a&nbsp;good replacement with the same qualities to&nbsp;let your kitty scratch and release its <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/996/95b/796199566789f928c0c0a59b12.png><p>Your dog gets sudden bursts of&nbsp;energy known as&nbsp;“the zoomies” when it’s really happy. It&nbsp;can also circle the room at&nbsp;spaceship speeds to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;energy build-up after some sleep. For puppies, zoomies can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;nervous energy reliever. That’s why they often do&nbsp;it&nbsp;after bathing.</p><p>Now, your cat loves to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=sink data-link=tag>sink</a> for nostalgic and temperature regulating reasons. First, the curvature gives them the same feeling of&nbsp;safety and pleasant pressure around them, they felt as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;litter. Second, the ceramics can serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice cool down surface after some time at&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm windowsill or&nbsp;elsewhere. Finally, your kitty might just be&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;spend more time with you as&nbsp;it&nbsp;knows you often visit the sink area.</p><p>If&nbsp;your fish starts rubbing itself on&nbsp;gravel, banging against objects in&nbsp;the tank, and swimming quickly without going anywhere, it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;really stressed. The reason could be&nbsp;improper water condition, conflicts with other fish, or&nbsp;unbalanced diet. Fish always need a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;hide and don’t like loud noises and banging coming from the outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6a1/476/9cba8056ff83276db54ad29cb4.png><p>Cats freak out when they see a&nbsp;cucumber because it&nbsp;looks too much like their long-time enemy&nbsp;— snakes. They’re naturally programmed to&nbsp;jump up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the air to&nbsp;prevent themselves from a&nbsp;bite. Anything that looks similar, from toys to&nbsp;eggplants, causes a&nbsp;similar reaction. It’s never a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;show them things like that for fun. It&nbsp;can really mess up&nbsp;their mental health.</p><p>Your dog never winks to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cuter on&nbsp;purpose. They do&nbsp;it&nbsp;when they have something in&nbsp;the eye or&nbsp;dry eye. It’s also a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;break some tension and avoid a&nbsp;fight. Direct eye contact is&nbsp;a&nbsp;show of&nbsp;challenge in&nbsp;dog world. Your pup winks at&nbsp;you or&nbsp;other dogs when it’s ready to&nbsp;back down.</p><p>Now, if&nbsp;your cat winks at&nbsp;you, it’s saying it&nbsp;feels really comfortable with you. Slow blinking in&nbsp;cats is&nbsp;called a&nbsp;cat kiss. You can try slowly shutting and then opening your eyes and see if&nbsp;the cat does the same.</p><p>Felines rarely sneer at&nbsp;humans, but do&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reaction to&nbsp;other cats’ invisible message. They can sense pheromones other cats leave in&nbsp;the environment. When they trap it&nbsp;with their tongues against the roof of&nbsp;the mouth, their lip curls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a6e/306/57bd2e57f3aeef71f0349c2b00.png><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;dogs like to&nbsp;move their bowl or&nbsp;some pieces of&nbsp;food from one location to&nbsp;another before eating. This way, they’re trying to&nbsp;protect their most precious resource. They think that, when they move&nbsp;it, no&nbsp;one will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find it&nbsp;and take it&nbsp;from them.</p><p>Cats often paw or&nbsp;knead the floor before or&nbsp;right after they eat. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;instinct that goes down in&nbsp;cat generations. Big cats do&nbsp;it, too. In&nbsp;the wild, they have to&nbsp;hide food remains so&nbsp;that their enemies can’t find them. If&nbsp;you don’t like your cat doing food caching, you can remove the bowl right when it’s done eating or&nbsp;distract it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;toy.</p><p>Hamsters love their wheels so&nbsp;much because they’re natural runners. In&nbsp;the wild, they can run long distances over the night. They need a&nbsp;wheel in&nbsp;the cage to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy, healthy and fit.</p><p>You can tell a&nbsp;hamster is&nbsp;happy when it&nbsp;stretches and plays with its bedding and toys. If&nbsp;it’s constantly biting the cage trying to&nbsp;escape, it’s not feeling good and comfy. You might want to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;bigger cage to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;feel better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fd5/de9/8404505165ab419ea43de9b054.png><p>If&nbsp;your cat is&nbsp;walking between your legs, it’s not trying to&nbsp;trip you, it’s trying to&nbsp;leave its scent on&nbsp;you to&nbsp;claim you as&nbsp;its property. It&nbsp;also rubs against your legs when it’s excited about getting some food. Now, kitties can be&nbsp;sneaky. They know such signs of&nbsp;affection make your heart melt, and you’ll give it&nbsp;what it&nbsp;wants.</p><p>Pet parrots inherited the habit to&nbsp;only eat a&nbsp;tiny bit of&nbsp;food and drop the rest from their wild ancestors. Scientists found that in&nbsp;the wild they mostly drop unripe fruits. They’re more careful with food during breeding season when they have little ones to&nbsp;feed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ba6/47d/c7b2005ee7893a41dd8115d971.png><p>And dogs sometimes bark and move their feet in&nbsp;their sleep because they’re dreaming. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;them, you’ll notice their eyes are closed but making rapid movements as&nbsp;they’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep sleep cycle.</p><p>Hey, my&nbsp;dog woofs and sometimes cries in&nbsp;his sleep, and his legs go&nbsp;crazy! That must be&nbsp;some dream! Hey, how about your pet?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYydpqCrXZe2tbGMnpicoF2kwamx0axkpqelqbW0ecinZKmkka56eX2ScWpwZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ouvrages-olympiques-la-solideo-va-restituer-39-millions-deuros-de-subventions-publiques.html><span>←</span><span>la Solideo va restituer 39 millions d'euros de subventions publiques</span></a>
