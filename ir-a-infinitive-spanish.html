Ir is the Spanish verb meaning “to go.” A means “to.” Add an unconjugated verb in the infinitive and you have a phrase in the near future tense in Spanish: ir a hablar (going to talk). Conjugate the verb ir and you have a complete sentence: Voy a hablar (I am going to talk).
This structure is extremely useful because ir is the verb we use to talk about anything that will happen soon."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Using the near future in Spanish: ir + a + infinitive</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The near future tense in Spanish has this structure:<strong> ir</strong><strong> +</strong><strong> a</strong><strong> + infinitive.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ir is the Spanish verb meaning “to go.” A means “to.” Add an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unconjugated verb</a> in the infinitive and you have a phrase in the near future tense in Spanish: ir a hablar (going to talk). Conjugate the verb ir and you have a complete sentence: Voy a hablar (I am going to talk).</p><p>This structure is extremely useful because ir is the verb we use to talk about anything that will happen soon. Since the syntax is not so different from English, native English speakers usually pick up on this structure quickly. You should be able to speak about future plans long before you master full verb conjugations in the future tense.</p><p>Today, we’ll learn how the ir + a + infinitive structure is formed, why it’s different from simple future and when to use it in conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Near-future-vs.-simple-future-in-Spanish>Near future vs. simple future in Spanish</h2><p>We covered how to conjugate the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">simple future tense</a> in Spanish before, but let’s review.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a chart showing the major difference between the near future (ir + a + infinitive) and the simple future tense for the Spanish verb hablar (to talk).</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=10><tr readability=2><td><strong>Subject</strong></td><td><strong>Near Future</strong></td><td><strong>Simple Future (conjugated)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>yo (I)</td><td>voy a hablar<br>(I’m going to talk)</td><td>hablaré<br>(I will talk)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>tú (you)</td><td>vas a hablar<br>(you are going to talk)</td><td>hablarás<br>(you will talk)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>él/ella (he/she)<br>usted (you; formal)</td><td>va a hablar<br>(he/she is going to talk; you are going to talk)</td><td>hablará<br>(he/she will talk; you will talk)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>nosotros (us)</td><td>vamos a hablar<br>(we are going to talk)</td><td>hablaremos<br>(we will talk)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>ellos/ellas (they)<br>ustedes (you; plural)</td><td>van a hablar<br>(they are going to talk; you all are going to talk)</td><td>hablarán<br>(they will talk; you all will talk)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>What does the formula ir + a + infinitive translate to in English? As you can see above, the literal translation is “going to [insert verb],”&nbsp;</p><p>Though slightly different, each phrase above communicates the same idea. They can even be used in the same conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Ir + a + infinitive is usually used because it’s easier. Notice that the near future phrase only requires you to conjugate one verb: ir. That’s why it’s an easy option!&nbsp;</p><p>The simple future requires you to memorize the conjugations for all verbs that exist. It’s the more advanced option, especially when you consider irregular verbs (spoiler alert: there are a lot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">irregular verbs in the future tense</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>So, let’s learn the easy way first.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>‘Ir + a + infinitive’ alternative terms</h3><p>When you are learning Spanish, it is typical to see this concept written in any of the following three formats in your learning materials.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>ir </strong><strong>+ </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>+ infinitive</strong>, with each word separated</li><li><strong>ir a </strong><strong>+ infinitive</strong>, split in two</li><li><strong>ir a </strong>future tense, with no separations</li></ul><p>Don’t worry, all three terms are correct and refer to the same thing. It is simply three different ways to demonstrate the same concept.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-‘ir-+-a-+-infinitivo’-formula>The ‘ir + a + infinitivo’ formula</h2><p>The near future tense will be easy for you to master due to the<strong> ir + a + infinitive</strong> formula or sentence structure. You only need to learn how to conjugate a single verb: ir.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Conjugate ‘ir’ in the present tense</h3><p>Here is how to conjugate ir (to go) in the present tense. It’s an irregular verb, but it’s probably familiar to you already.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=2><tr><td><strong>Subject</strong></td><td><strong>Ir (conjugated)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>yo (I)</td><td>voy</td></tr><tr><td>tú (you)</td><td>vas</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>él/ella (he/she)<br>usted (you; formal)</td><td>va</td></tr><tr><td>nosotros (us)</td><td>vamos</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>ellos/ellas (they)<br>ustedes (you; plural)</td><td>van</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Insert ‘a’ (to)</h3><p>After you’ve conjugated the verb ir to match your subject, insert the preposition a (to go).&nbsp;</p><p>A is one of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common prepositions in Spanish</a>, so it may also be familiar to you. This word never changes — it’s just a single letter a.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Add a verb infinitive at the end</h3><p>Finally, add a verb at the end of the phrase. Remember: <strong>You do not conjugate this verb</strong>. It stays in its infinitive form, meaning it keeps the ending in -ar, -er, or -ir.&nbsp;</p><p>These unconjugated “base forms” of the verbs look like this: hablar (to talk), comer (to eat) or escribir (to write).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Ir-+-a-+-infinitive-examples>Ir + a + infinitive examples</h2><p>When we follow these steps and plug different words into the <strong>ir </strong><strong>+</strong><strong> a</strong><strong> + infinitive</strong> formula, we can create full sentences talking about the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some <strong>ir </strong><strong>+</strong><strong> a</strong><strong> + infinitive</strong> examples that you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Voy a tomar</strong> un café. (I am going to have a coffee.)</li><li>¿<strong>Vas a traer </strong>el libro a clase el lunes? (Are you going to bring the book to class on Monday?)</li><li>Ella <strong>va a viajar</strong> a Alemania para el verano. (She is going to travel to Germany for the summer).</li><li>¿<strong>Vamos a estudiar</strong> en la biblioteca? (Are we going to study in the library?)</li><li><strong>Van a tener</strong> que limpiar la casa. (They are going to have to clean the house.)</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ir + a + infinitive examples with pronouns</h3><p>When you add pronouns to the mix, it’s important to know where they belong in this structure. Take the first two examples above. Here, they are rewritten using <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">direct object pronouns</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Lo</strong> voy a tomar. (I am going to drink it.)</li><li>¿Vas a traer<strong>lo</strong> a clase el lunes? (Are you going to bring it to class on Monday?)</li></ul><p>Notice that the pronoun never goes in the middle. The<strong> ir + a + infinitive </strong>structure is never broken. The pronoun must go either (1) at the beginning, or (2) attached to the infinitive verb at the end.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The immediate future is yours</h2><p>As you can see, the near future tense (ir + a + infinitive) is used to talk about anything in the immediate future. This phrasing is useful for talking about weekend or future plans, telling somebody where you are going, coordinating plans with friends, gossiping, making suggestions about the future, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, we encourage you to master <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced Spanish</a> skills, but it’s smart to start with the easy stuff. Based on these examples, are you ready to create your own <strong>ir + a + infinitive </strong>near future tense phrases?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
