These couples decided to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;bold decision and opted for separate beds or&nbsp;even separate bedrooms. And surprisingly, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;total game-changer for them.

<a href=../../../../back-to-black-amy-winehouse-real-people.html></a>
Sam Taylor Johnson’s hotly anticipated Amy Winehouse biopic, Back to Black, was contested by the late musician’s fans from the day it was announced. For some, it felt too soon following Winehouse’s untimely death in 2011; for others, a musical drama invited the possibility of caricature at best and exploitation at worst.
Fresh in the mind of Winehouse fans was Asif Kapadia’s 2015 documentary, Amy, which shed light on her on-and-off romantic relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, who introduced the young singer to hard drugs, and her father, who has disputed the film’s depiction of him as greedy and uncaring.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lindsay Lohan Wants To Open Her Own Rehab Center</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>

Lindsay Lohan’s mom, Dina, told The Today Show on Monday that her daughter’s (repeated) experiences in rehab has inspired the former Disney star to open her own rehab center. Lohan, who is in rehab at this very moment for failing a random drug test, has been in more headlines lately for her alleged drug use and trouble with the law than she has been for her film roles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nicki Minaj Debuts New Look In Alexander McQueen!</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>

When she stepped out for the 2014-MTV-Movie-Awards she left a lot of us in awe! She was chic and stunning in a black figure hugging Alexander McQueen dress (maybe she sacked her stylist!). She was beautiful, a sight not common with Nicki Minaj! Her signature crazy tresses were traded for a side swept ombre look, dewy nude make-up look with stunning gold accessories; she was spot on (our thoughts)!

Speaking during a recent interview with Karefa Johnson from Essence Magazine, Tems highlighted that her distinctive dress sense is a natural outcome of being true to herself rather than trying to communicate a particular message. The singer explained, "You should be yourself even if something else is expected of you. You win, automatically, when you are yourself, no matter what that looks like. That’s why there’s variety." Tems addressed the pressure to conform to certain styles, especially for artists and women, stressing that because people are different, there shouldn't be a standard for dressing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>VP Debate Will Be All About Introducing the Candidates</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>
