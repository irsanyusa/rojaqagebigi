Can you see those giant creatures the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Volkswagen Beetle? Those are <strong>Manta Rays</strong>. They’ve got a&nbsp;long whip-like tail and large, flat diamond bodies. There are two species of&nbsp;<strong>Manta Rays</strong>&nbsp;— the <strong>Reef Manta Ray</strong> and the <strong>Giant Manta Ray</strong>. They belong to&nbsp;the same family as&nbsp;sharks, but they only have small teeth in&nbsp;their lower jaw. They feed on&nbsp;zooplankton, tiny fish, and crustaceans.</p><p>Manta Rays are social animals, and they like people. Once you let them come close to&nbsp;you, they’ll swim around you to&nbsp;observe you<strong>.</strong> Don’t chase them, though, because they’re superfast swimmers. Their name translates to&nbsp;“<strong>cloak</strong>” or&nbsp;“<strong>blanket</strong>,” and out of&nbsp;all sea creatures, they’ve got the largest brain compared to&nbsp;body-weight ratio. These fellas can recognize themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror.</p><p>The <strong>Asian sheepshead wrasse</strong> follows. Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems unsightly, it’s one of&nbsp;the friendliest fish you’ll come across in&nbsp;the shallow waters of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a>, <a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a>, and Korea. It&nbsp;has protrusions on&nbsp;both his jaw and head. It&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;its anemone, and it’s usually scared to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out, even at&nbsp;<strong>40&nbsp;in (100&nbsp;cm)</strong> long.</p><p>One of&nbsp;these fellas developed a&nbsp;<a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> with a&nbsp;Japanese scuba diver 30&nbsp;years ago. When the diver found the fish, it&nbsp;was injured, and he&nbsp;helped it&nbsp;recover. The diver had been the caretaker of&nbsp;an&nbsp;underwater <strong>Shinto Shrine</strong>. He&nbsp;calls the fish by&nbsp;hitting the underwater bell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/070/354/ecf3fc5617ba36587ada9d624a.png><p>Time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;swimming with the largest fish in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— the <strong>whale shark</strong>. Though these creatures <i>are</i> sharks, they have a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;common with whales. They can live for 100&nbsp;years, though they’ve got tiny brains. They’re indifferent to&nbsp;humans. These fellas don’t care about anything they can’t eat.</p><p>And, unlike other shark species, they won’t bite you. Whale sharks are <strong>filter feeders</strong>. They do&nbsp;have teeth&nbsp;— 3,000 of&nbsp;them! —&nbsp;but they don’t use them. They’ve got a&nbsp;massive mouth, like&nbsp;me, but their throat is&nbsp;only the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarter.</p><p>Next, we&nbsp;have the <strong>sunfish</strong>. A&nbsp;fish without a&nbsp;tail that looks like it’s been cut in&nbsp;half. It&nbsp;has large fins, and when you see it&nbsp;breaching on&nbsp;the surface, you’ll think a&nbsp;shark is&nbsp;approaching. The sunfish dives deep in&nbsp;the water to&nbsp;let other fish exfoliate its skin and remove parasites.</p><p>Once they’re done, it&nbsp;returns to&nbsp;the surface to&nbsp;sunbathe. It’s also a&nbsp;voracious eater. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;sees you in&nbsp;the waters, it’ll likely approach you and observe you. Within a&nbsp;day, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;feed it&nbsp;from the palm of&nbsp;your hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5c0/11c/9d07fd5fe08c8b1d5ea227867c.png><p>Time for the animal that looks like it’s always smiling&nbsp;— the <strong>bottlenose dolphin</strong>. It’s one of&nbsp;the most social sea creatures, and it&nbsp;travels in&nbsp;groups. It&nbsp;enjoys playing, hunting, raising calves, and helping out its community. Bottlenose dolphins are excellent swimmers with speeds reaching <strong>19&nbsp;mph (30&nbsp;kph)</strong>.</p><p>They usually come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface to&nbsp;breathe air through the blowhole on&nbsp;their head. These creatures are great communicators, and they send messages to&nbsp;each other. They use echolocation to&nbsp;navigate and find food. When they spot people, they become very friendly&nbsp;— so&nbsp;much that they let their guard down, and it&nbsp;makes them vulnerable to&nbsp;other sea creatures such as&nbsp;sharks.</p><p>Heading to&nbsp;the Pacific Coast, we’ll come across some <strong>Gray Whales</strong>. Their skin is&nbsp;covered with parasites and other organisms that make their snouts look like rough pieces of&nbsp;<a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a>. We&nbsp;gotta get on&nbsp;their nice side first. Gray Whales can attack a&nbsp;large boat, a&nbsp;ship, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;vessel if&nbsp;they sense their calves are in&nbsp;danger.</p><p>But, generally, they’re friendly and appear unbothered by&nbsp;rowing kayakers. In&nbsp;some cases, they approach small boats and allow humans to&nbsp;touch them, though you’re required by&nbsp;law to&nbsp;keep your <strong>distance</strong>. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;get closer, it&nbsp;will. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;feels threatened, it&nbsp;will act aggressively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ac4/713/e297dd538eaac3ecc6aa3b6773.png><p>Now, let me&nbsp;show you a&nbsp;fish with a&nbsp;tool on&nbsp;its head&nbsp;— the <strong>hammerhead shark</strong>. Their skull helps them with hunting. Their eyes are placed on&nbsp;the “hammer’s” outer edges and gives them a&nbsp;360-degree vertical view. But they’ve got a&nbsp;blind spot in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;their nose. Their heads are like metal detectors&nbsp;— most of&nbsp;what they want is&nbsp;below the sand’s surface.</p><p>So, they lightly dip their heads in&nbsp;the sand and sweep-up whatever is&nbsp;under there. You’ll see them in&nbsp;temperate and tropical waters both near the shorelines and offshore. They usually move in&nbsp;groups. They’re mostly harmless to&nbsp;humans and divers, but there have been a&nbsp;few occasions<strong> </strong>where they got aggressive. But before they&nbsp;do, they’ll give you a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;warning signs, and divers know how to&nbsp;handle them.</p><p>Now I’ll show you something kinda smaller&nbsp;— the <strong>Sea Lion</strong>. These creatures are a&nbsp;bit tricky. They’re playful, aggressive, arrogant, smart, and above all, curious. Sea lions can’t breathe underwater, but they can dive almost <strong>1,000&nbsp;ft (300&nbsp;m)</strong> deep, and they can hold their breath for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>They take in&nbsp;air through their nose, and once they dip their heads in&nbsp;the waters, their nostrils slam shut. If&nbsp;they spot humans at&nbsp;the beach, they’ll stay away and wait for them to&nbsp;leave. Wild sea lions aren’t the friendliest to&nbsp;anyone, especially if&nbsp;they feel threatened. The approachable ones have been trained in&nbsp;captivity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d65/4db/bb1ddd5520ac1d0a04f5a72759.png><p><strong>Beluga</strong> whales are next. They’re white with bulgy heads, and they’re amongst the most social and loudest you’ll ever meet. Their upwards-facing mouths make them look like they’re smiling. When Beluga whales are born, they’re a&nbsp;dark gray shade. It&nbsp;takes 8&nbsp;years for their skin to&nbsp;turn white.</p><p>They can change the shape of&nbsp;their heads by&nbsp;blowing air around their sinuses. Beluga whales love humans. Once they make human friends, they don’t want to&nbsp;leave. Even though they’re wild animals, they become too entrusting with people. Marine biologists suggest staying away for their safety.</p><p>Have you heard of&nbsp;sea cows? Those are actually called <strong>manatees</strong>. You’ll see some in&nbsp;rivers and others in&nbsp;the oceans. Even though they’re large, they usually stay in&nbsp;shallow coastal areas&nbsp;— munching on&nbsp;seagrass, leaves, and algae.</p><p>Manatees bring their heads to&nbsp;the surface every 4&nbsp;minutes or&nbsp;so&nbsp;to&nbsp;breathe, but they can hold their breath longer than that. They’re slow travelers, and even if&nbsp;they aren’t as&nbsp;smart as&nbsp;dolphins, they can understand colors. These fellas are gentle giants, and they like to&nbsp;approach humans searching for warmth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/863/352/d8a1ad5570b65c2a98d7470a0a.png><p>Next, we’ve got the <strong>basking shark&nbsp;</strong>— the second largest shark in&nbsp;the world. Their mouth is&nbsp;their most impressive feature, like&nbsp;me, since it&nbsp;can open more than <strong>3&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;m)</strong> wide, okay you win. These creatures have an&nbsp;intimidating appearance.</p><p>But, despite their size, they’re harmless to&nbsp;humans, and divers swim with them. They’re very social and can form schools of&nbsp;<strong>100</strong>&nbsp;individuals. They swim near the water’s surface, filter-feeding on&nbsp;plankton. They, too, have a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;teeth that they don’t use.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know which creature<strong> </strong>can sing loud “songs” for <strong>30&nbsp;minutes</strong>? Actually, it’s the <strong>Humpback Whale</strong>. Scientists aren’t sure why they make those low howls and noises&nbsp;— they might be&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;communicate with others to&nbsp;attract mates. You’ll see them near coastlines feeding on&nbsp;tiny food, and they use their flukes to&nbsp;propel through the water.</p><p>Humpback whales are less friendly than gray whales because they’re very cautious. But, they’re the heroes of&nbsp;the ocean. They try to&nbsp;save other animals from <strong>Orcas</strong>, and experts say they’re capable of&nbsp;decision-making and problem-solving. On&nbsp;one occasion, a&nbsp;humpback whale jumped in&nbsp;to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;whale biologist from a&nbsp;tiger shark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37c/840/c02e675a0c9c6bbd64b2ea8ab1.png><p>Now, let’s try to&nbsp;spot the expert in&nbsp;disguise: The <strong>Caribbean Reef Octopus</strong>. The specialized color cells help it&nbsp;blend in&nbsp;with the sand and ocean rocks’ rough texture. But Caribbean Reef Octopuses are loners&nbsp;— and they like to&nbsp;get around on&nbsp;their own.</p><p>This creature is&nbsp;also teeny tiny. It&nbsp;can grow almost<strong> 5&nbsp;in (13&nbsp;cm)</strong> and with their legs getting as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;the average person’s foot. If&nbsp;you get too close to&nbsp;them, they’ll likely turn blue and warn you that they feel threatened. Even though they’re trusting, it’s better to&nbsp;keep your distance to&nbsp;keep them calm.</p><p>A&nbsp;weird-looking creature walks around like a&nbsp;living vacuum cleaner down in&nbsp;the oceans’ pitch-black depths. I’m talking about <strong>Sea Pigs</strong>. They got their name from their pinkish bodies, and they fit in&nbsp;the palm of&nbsp;your hand. These creatures don’t swim, they walk around on&nbsp;the seafloor. Their legs consist of&nbsp;5&nbsp;to&nbsp;7&nbsp;pairs of&nbsp;enlarged tube feet, and they have tentacles around their mouths to&nbsp;fiddle through the mud to&nbsp;find scum to&nbsp;munch&nbsp;on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b3d/380/52fc8a5123ae6ff1671764cebb.png><p><strong>Yumbo</strong>! Since they’re vulnerable, they have <strong>poisonous skin</strong> for protection against other sea creatures. If&nbsp;you encounter one, it’ll be&nbsp;quite friendly, but if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pet, you’ll need a&nbsp;VERY deep tank.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;slimy water creatures, let’s talk about <strong>comb jellies</strong>. They’re friendly animals that like to&nbsp;swim close to&nbsp;the shore on&nbsp;warm summer evenings. There are two types of&nbsp;comb jellies&nbsp;— some with two tentacles and some without any. You can spot them at&nbsp;night since they glow in&nbsp;the dark and light up&nbsp;the waters.</p><p>One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;the <strong>Sea Gooseberry</strong>. On&nbsp;the sand, it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;transparent blob of&nbsp;Jell-O, and it&nbsp;can fit into a&nbsp;teaspoon. Unlikely jellyfish, comb jellies don’t sting because they don’t have stinging cells, and they’re safe to&nbsp;swim with.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH51edKcmKuxXaG8sLfIp55mq5WWeqS%2BxJqrrqqVqHq1tMCtZJynpaGxbq7EZrCoraJis7O1xKebrGVoZoF5fZJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1607620-zlatko-dalic-age-net-worth-nationality-coaching-career-family-salary.html><span>←</span><span>Zlatko Dali: age, net worth, nationality, coaching career, family, salary</span></a>
