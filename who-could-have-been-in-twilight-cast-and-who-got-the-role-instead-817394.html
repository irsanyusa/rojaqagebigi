However, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Gossip Girl</i></a> star, Michelle, explained that scheduling conflicts became a&nbsp;hurdle as&nbsp;she was on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> at&nbsp;the time and the schedules never worked out.</p><p>Despite the missed opportunity, the actress revealed that she doesn’t want to&nbsp;dwell on&nbsp;the past and what might have been, saying that if&nbsp;you&nbsp;do, you’re not living in&nbsp;the moment, and you’re looking negatively at&nbsp;what you’re doing now.</p><p>Michelle, though, doesn’t regret not starring in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i> as&nbsp;she already had her vampire role in&nbsp;<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, starring as&nbsp;Buffy’s little sister.</p><p><h2>Taylor Swift wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movie franchise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/adb/075/f3d422512e822b5b3c0c85bc64.jpg><p><a href=# title="Taylor Swift" data-link=tag>Taylor Swift</a> expressed her desire to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;<i>The Twilight Saga: New Moon</i>, revealing her status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;devoted fan of&nbsp;<strong>Stephenie Meyer’s </strong><i><strong>Twilight</strong></i><strong> series</strong>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;director Chris Weitz, who worked on&nbsp;the film, Swift’s agent conveyed her interest, emphasizing that she would be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;even the smallest role. Weitz shared this amusing anecdote during an&nbsp;interview on&nbsp;Ashley Greene’s podcast, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Twilight Effect</i></a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;the podcast, Weitz explained that Swift’s agent conveyed, “’Taylor would like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;this movie—not because of&nbsp;you, but she’s a&nbsp;Twi-hard.’” Despite the agent’s assurance that Swift could handle any role, Weitz decided not to&nbsp;cast her in&nbsp;the film. The director humorously mentioned that Swift could have portrayed a&nbsp;character in&nbsp;the cafeteria or&nbsp;diner, but the opportunity didn’t materialize. The revelation adds an&nbsp;interesting twist to&nbsp;Swift’s <i>Twilight</i> fandom and her eagerness to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the beloved franchise.</p><p><h2>Channing Tatum was the screenwriter’s choice to&nbsp;play Riley Biers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43e/22b/3ba16a554d86625e745eb46170.jpg><p>Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believed</a> that <a href=# title="Channing Tatum" data-link=tag>Channing Tatum</a> would have been an&nbsp;ideal choice to&nbsp;play the bad-boy vampire Riley in&nbsp;the third installment of&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> series, Eclipse. She expressed confidence in&nbsp;Tatum’s ability to&nbsp;handle the character’s complexities and tragic elements, especially in&nbsp;the crucial battle scenes.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Rosenberg, Tatum could beautifully convey the character’s journey, making the audience feel the heartbreak as&nbsp;he&nbsp;realizes his connection to&nbsp;the antagonist, Victoria. Sadly, at&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;was already working on&nbsp;several other movies.</p><p><h2>Cillian Murphy as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the villains in&nbsp;the franchise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fa/6d8/85c88b575f8d1fce95e11dcb82.jpg><p>Initially, Meyer was considering Joshua Jackson for the role of&nbsp;James. However, upon seeing Cillian Murphy, particularly in&nbsp;his performance in&nbsp;the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Batman Begins</i> </a>directed by&nbsp;Christopher Nolan, she changed her preference, and Murphy became her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>top choice</a> for the role.</p><p>Despite this, the character of&nbsp;the villainous vampire, James, was ultimately played by&nbsp;Cam Gigandet.</p><p><h2>Lily Collins auditioned for the role of&nbsp;Bella Swan early in&nbsp;her acting career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fef/ed9/a7a7115bd3b6447a5fe6460400.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Emily in&nbsp;Paris</i></a> actress Lily Collins disclosed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went through</a> the audition process before Kristen Stewart to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Bella Swan in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>. Collins talked about her early audition experiences and the doubts and fears that come with being a&nbsp;budding performer. Collins underlined her conviction that everything in&nbsp;casting happens for a&nbsp;purpose, even though she withheld specifics on&nbsp;the audition procedure.</p><p>Even though Collins was passed up&nbsp;for the <i>Twilight</i> role, she and Stewart ended up&nbsp;playing Snow White in&nbsp;other adaptations. Collins brushed off any talk of&nbsp;competition, expressing enthusiasm for Stewart’s roles and highlighting the support of&nbsp;fellow performers.</p><p><h2>Henry Cavill was the original choice to&nbsp;play Edward Cullen, but Robert Pattison got the role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f3/9cd/13e6e55cd8826c17486a823fed.jpg><p>Stephenie Meyer’s top choice for the role of&nbsp;Edward Cullen in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> films was the <i>Superman</i> star Henry Cavil. <i>Twilight</i> author Stephenie Meyer initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>envisioned</a> the Superman star <a href=# title="Henry Cavill" data-link=tag>Henry Cavill</a> as&nbsp;the ideal Edward Cullen for the movie adaptations. In&nbsp;2007, she revealed that the most disappointing thing for her was losing the “perfect Edward” as&nbsp;Henry Cavill was 24&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time which, ultimately, was too old for the role.</p><p>Henry didn’t know about this at&nbsp;the time, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t even asked to&nbsp;play the role. But later, when he&nbsp;found out that they wanted to&nbsp;cast him for the role, he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would have been cool to&nbsp;play Edward.</p><p><h2>Vanessa Hudgens was rumored to&nbsp;have auditioned for the role of&nbsp;Leah Clearwater.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14e/3a4/51c39859e2b14c7ad7b748f566.jpg><p>There were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors</a> that Vanessa Hudgens auditioned for the role of&nbsp;Leah Clearwater, the lone female shapeshifter in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> saga. In&nbsp;the novels, Leah has a&nbsp;complex relationship with Bella and plays a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;the werewolf tribe. However, her part was notably reduced in&nbsp;the movie adaptations.</p><p>Despite initial speculation, the role eventually went to&nbsp;Julia Jones. Hudgens’ connection to&nbsp;the role remains unclear, but her potential casting and subsequent exclusion from the <i>Twilight</i> franchise align her with other notable actors, who ultimately turned them down. Despite the lack of&nbsp;confirmation, Ashley Greene, who played Alice, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her belief that Vanessa would have been great in&nbsp;the role.</p><p><h2>Lucy Hale auditioned twice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff5/882/8bf7d65f73b21988aeea6f11d5.jpg><p>Lucy Hale, known for her role in&nbsp;the famous&nbsp;TV series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pretty Little Liars</i></a>, was a&nbsp;passionate fan of&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> book series. Eager to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the cinematic adaptation, she auditioned not once, but twice, for different roles within the <i>Twilight</i> franchise. Her first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attempt</a> was for the character Alice Cullen, and despite not landing the part, Hale didn’t let the initial setback deter her. Undeterred, she returned to&nbsp;audition for a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the sequel, <i>New Moon</i>, this time aiming for the character Jane.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite her enthusiasm and determination, Lucy Hale <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>did not secure</a> a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> cast. Nevertheless, her persistence in&nbsp;auditioning for distinct roles serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the unpredictable and competitive nature of&nbsp;the casting process in&nbsp;the film industry. It&nbsp;also underscores the journey that actors often navigate, facing both successes and setbacks as&nbsp;they pursue opportunities in&nbsp;the dynamic world of&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p><h2>Tyler Posey was supposed to&nbsp;play Jacob.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66f/120/f5ddb05295a03f4e6b8dd903a0.jpg><p>Tyler Posey, the actor renowned for his role as&nbsp;Scott McCall on&nbsp;MTV’s “Teen Wolf,” was actually the personal choice of&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i> author <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Stephenie Meyer</a> for the pivotal role of&nbsp;Jacob Black. Posey shared during an&nbsp;appearance on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i></a> in&nbsp;January that he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;direct competition with Taylor Lautner for the coveted role in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;that period, Posey acknowledged that although landing the role would have been a&nbsp;significant career boost, he&nbsp;was only 16&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time and felt unprepared for the intense attention that would come with such a&nbsp;high-profile part. Despite losing out on&nbsp;the role to&nbsp;Lautner, Posey maintained a&nbsp;positive outlook on&nbsp;his career trajectory.</p><p>Interestingly, Posey and Lautner were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>familiar</a> with each other, having crossed paths at&nbsp;numerous auditions. Posey discovered he&nbsp;hadn’t secured the role of&nbsp;Jacob from Lautner himself when they met again at&nbsp;a&nbsp;subsequent audition after the completion of&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i> filming.</p><p>Tyler Posey eventually found his werewolf stride by&nbsp;securing the lead role of&nbsp;Scott McCall in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Teen Wolf</i></a>, which ran successfully from 2011 to&nbsp;2017. While he&nbsp;might have missed out on&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> fame, Posey’s journey led him to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;prominent figure in&nbsp;the supernatural&nbsp;TV genre.</p><p><h2>Shiloh Fernandez didn’t win Edward’s role because he&nbsp;didn’t pass the chemistry test.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/0b8/ecf9915ad591ce2373bc12a205.jpg><p>Shiloh Fernandez, one of&nbsp;the four contenders for the role of&nbsp;Edward in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>, underwent a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chemistry</a> test with Kristen Stewart, the chosen Bella, at&nbsp;director Catherine Hardwicke’s home. Even though Fernandez signed contracts, had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>screen test</a>, and initially showed enthusiasm for the job, he&nbsp;subsequently acknowledged that he&nbsp;wasn’t psychologically ready for the character’s possible success. He&nbsp;confessed to&nbsp;being nervous throughout the chemistry exam and admitted to&nbsp;not having a&nbsp;connection with Stewart.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with Interview magazine in&nbsp;2010, Fernandez mentioned how close he&nbsp;was to&nbsp;landing the part, but he&nbsp;also stressed that he&nbsp;didn’t think he&nbsp;was the proper fit for it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2011 interview with Wonderland magazine, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> satisfaction at&nbsp;not getting the part.</p><p>Fortunately, things took a&nbsp;positive turn for Fernandez when <i>Twilight</i> director Catherine Hardwicke later cast him as&nbsp;Peter, the love interest of&nbsp;Amanda Seyfried in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Red Riding Hood</i></a>. This time, the chemistry on-screen was more palpable, and Fernandez expressed gratitude to&nbsp;Hardwicke for the opportunity, describing their collaboration as&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect match.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence auditioned for the role of&nbsp;Bella.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10d/a0e/7f9bea58f59341c16274f91050.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a> isn’t upset about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>not getting</a> a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>. She auditioned to&nbsp;play Bella Swan in&nbsp;the franchise, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t even get</a> a&nbsp;call back. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent interview, she said, “They turned me&nbsp;down immediately. I&nbsp;didn’t even get a&nbsp;callback. But my&nbsp;life would’ve been totally different. I&nbsp;got ‘<i>Hunger Games</i>’ I&nbsp;think, like, a&nbsp;year later. It&nbsp;was probably after <i>‘Winter’s Bone</i>.’”</p><p>Looking back, Lawrence shared, “I&nbsp;was still in&nbsp;a&nbsp;franchise, so&nbsp;I was still trying to&nbsp;counteract the franchise-ness. I’d still be&nbsp;doing that if&nbsp;I was in ‘<i>Twilight</i>.’ But I&nbsp;almost didn’t do ‘<i>Hunger Games</i>’ because ‘<i>Twilight</i>’ had come out, and that fandom had happened.”</p><p>Talking about fame, she explained, “When I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;people about making this decision after [<i>‘Hunger Games</i>’] got offered to&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was hard to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;people... this level of&nbsp;fame,” Lawrence said. “I&nbsp;assumed it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the ‘<i>Twilight</i>’ level of&nbsp;fame, and that was never something&nbsp;I had in&nbsp;mind. I&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most famous person on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=planet data-link=tag>planet</a>. That’s a&nbsp;very different life than&nbsp;I pictured for&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Taylor Lautner almost didn’t make it&nbsp;for <i>New Moon</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/202/5db/2ba5ae5ea2b408b68027f2de0e.jpg><p>An&nbsp;intriguing casting idea for Michael Copon’s role as&nbsp;Jacob in&nbsp;<i>New Moon</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>almost</a> made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;production. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reasoning</a> for the possible alteration was Jacob’s aging process, even if&nbsp;there are risks involved when recasting a&nbsp;major character in&nbsp;a&nbsp;franchise. Jacob was meant to&nbsp;age organically, not like the eternal seventeen-year-old he&nbsp;depicted. But Jacob’s actor, Taylor Lautner, remained youthful-looking, which presented a&nbsp;problem for the plot.</p><p>Prematurely announcing the recasting, studio executives stated they wanted to&nbsp;cast Michael as&nbsp;the new Jacob, which led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;great deal of&nbsp;uncertainty. Although this move’s veracity is&nbsp;yet unknown, it&nbsp;may have been a&nbsp;PR gimmick. It&nbsp;is, nonetheless, reasonable to&nbsp;think about recasting to&nbsp;represent an&nbsp;“older” Jacob. The problem was solved by&nbsp;concentrating on&nbsp;improving Taylor Lautner’s body to&nbsp;match the character’s evolution. They gave Taylor Lautner more muscle to&nbsp;flaunt his toned physique.</p><p><h2>Edward could have been played by&nbsp;Dustin Milligan as&nbsp;well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f68/1af/352f215301bff135bce16a0b1f.jpg><p>Known for his work on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>90210</i></a>, Dustin Milligan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tried </a>out for the role of&nbsp;Edward Cullen in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>, but he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;lighthearted comment about how his lack of&nbsp;a&nbsp;British accent cost him the part. Even though Edward didn’t have an&nbsp;accent in&nbsp;the film, Milligan recognized <a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a>’s success and gave his British voice some of&nbsp;the credit.</p><p>Kristen Stewart, his co-star in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Messengers</i></a> and&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>In the Land of&nbsp;Women</i></a>, was complimented by&nbsp;Milligan, who also noted her brilliance and projected that she would have success outside of&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> franchise.</p><p><h2>James Franco as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra vampire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/990/208/8d279f5065883e1eb7ded61f96.jpg><p><i>Breaking Dawn</i> director Bill Condon revealed that he&nbsp;considered casting James Franco as&nbsp;a&nbsp;vampire extra in&nbsp;the film. However, Condon changed his mind due to&nbsp;Franco’s high profile, fearing it&nbsp;would make his presence in&nbsp;the movie too conspicuous. Condon explained that involving Franco in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;role would have required him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;set for an&nbsp;extended period, creating a&nbsp;challenge in&nbsp;scenes with a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Franco had expressed his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interest</a> in&nbsp;being part of&nbsp;<i>Breaking Dawn</i>, hoping to&nbsp;incorporate his performance into a&nbsp;multimedia project related to&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> phenomenon.
