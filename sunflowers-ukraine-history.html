From <a href=# rel=noopener>Mexico City</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>Caracas,</a> protesters held up sunflowers as they took to the street to condemn Russia’s actions. In London, sunflowers <a href=# rel=noopener>poke out of the barricades</a> in front of the building housing Sunflowers for Peace, a charity organizing aid for Ukrainian residents, while <a href=# rel=noopener>in Reno, Nev.,</a> they emerge from a public art piece that spells out “BELIEVE.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Globally, awareness of the association between sunflowers and Ukraine has grown since Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion, when the news outlet Ukraine World shared <a href=# rel=noopener>a video</a> on Twitter showing a Ukrainian woman in Henychesk giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers, with the striking instruction to put the seeds in their pockets so the flowers will grow where they die. The video has racked up <a href=# rel=noopener>8.6 million views</a> on Twitter since it was uploaded on Feb. 24, and comedian John Oliver featured it on <a href=# rel=noopener>Last Week Tonight</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Read More:</b><i> </i><i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘We Will Defend Ourselves.’ Photographs of Ukraine Under Attack</a></i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the flower has an even longer history in the country. Sunflowers—soniashnyk in Ukrainian—have been grown in Ukraine since the mid-18th century, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>a 1993 Encyclopedia of Ukraine.</a> At the time of the book’s publication, sunflower seeds were the country’s most popular snack. The flower also helps fuel the national economy today; Ukraine and Russia supply up to <a href=# rel=noopener>70</a>–<a href=# rel=noopener>80%</a> of the world’s sunflower oil exports.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The ubiquitous presence of the sunflower in the villages and countryside of Ukraine has made it an unofficial national symbol,” <a href=# rel=noopener>the encyclopedia says</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Throughout Ukraine’s history, the flower has been used as a symbol of peace. In June 1996, to celebrate Ukraine <a href=# rel=noopener>giving up nuclear weapons</a>, U.S., Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers <a href=# rel=noopener>planted sunflowers</a> in a ceremony at southern Ukraine’s Pervomaysk missile base.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The ceremony celebrated Ukraine’s abandonment of the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, which it inherited in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,” the Washington Post <a href=# rel=noopener>reported back then</a>. “It also marked the near completion of a primary U.S. strategic goal since the Soviet breakup: to gather all ex-Soviet nuclear weapons in Russia, thus avoiding a proliferation of nuclear powers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than 25 years after that ceremony, Russian and Ukrainian ministers are at war, but the meaning of the sunflowers as symbols of peace has not changed, as the cropping up of sunflowers worldwide has become a call on leaders to plant the seeds again for a more peaceful future.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With reporting by Abby Vesoulis</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWVpgXF8jqysp56cpMSmvtJmrKSqkZ67pnnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-gray-man-netflix-books-cia.html><span>←</span><span>The Gray Man: Story Behind Adapting the CIA Thriller</span></a>
