Their great mother-and-son relationship only shows that, in&nbsp;real life, Kudrow is&nbsp;every bit as&nbsp;cool and fun as&nbsp;her popular onscreen character.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>loves how Kudrow is&nbsp;rocking motherhood, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;her parenting approaches based on&nbsp;her previous interviews. Read until the end for a&nbsp;bonus quote from her son, Julian, which will surely tug at&nbsp;your heartstrings.</p><p><h2>1. She valued having supportive friends during her pregnancy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/0c0/196/3481b955bdab0af79a03e64d08.jpeg><p>Most of&nbsp;us remember that her character Phoebe became a&nbsp;<a href=#>surrogate</a> mother for triplets on&nbsp;the show. While filming those episodes, Kudrow was actually pregnant with Julian, her child with her husband Michel Stern.</p><p>In&nbsp;one <a href=#>interview</a>, <strong>the actress expressed her appreciation for the support she received from the cast</strong> during her <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>. She said “The 6&nbsp;of&nbsp;us would do&nbsp;a&nbsp;huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a&nbsp;good show, love you, love you, love you, love you.’ And when&nbsp;I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a&nbsp;great show, love you, love you&nbsp;— love you, little Julian!’... So&nbsp;sweet, they included my&nbsp;little fetus in&nbsp;the huddle.”</p><p><h2>2. She embraced motherhood and the changes it&nbsp;brought to&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a8d/2a1/c265aa58f6a1e1df2c2d22e474.png><p>Kudrow said that <strong>being a&nbsp;mother made her </strong><a href=#><strong>fear</strong></a><strong> for the first time</strong>, and there were times when she felt disappointed because she didn’t know what to&nbsp;do. Motherhood also made her more <a href=#>emotional</a>, which she believes was a&nbsp;good thing for her acting career. Anything about her child easily made her cry and having Julian opened new feelings for her to&nbsp;draw from, especially in&nbsp;dramatic scenes.</p><p><h2>3. She handled it&nbsp;well when Julian thought Jennifer Aniston was his “mommy.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f8/8a7/45c6525106a52a938cbf99f5a2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her sit-down <a href=#>interview</a> with Conan O’Brien, Kudrow shared that, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, Julian would fly into <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a>’s lap whenever he&nbsp;visited the set. She also revealed that, at&nbsp;home, Julian would see Aniston on&nbsp;TV and call her “mommy.”</p><p>O’Brien asked if&nbsp;that moment was scarring for her, and Kudrow responded that she became analytical and questioned if&nbsp;she was lacking a&nbsp;special connection that Julian shared with Aniston. But at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, she still felt happy for both of&nbsp;them and said <strong>she was “always glad for anyone that Julian felt love for, and felt from.”</strong></p><p><h2>4. She makes an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;explain her decisions.</h2></p><p>Kudrow <a href=#>believes</a> that one of&nbsp;her best parental qualities is&nbsp;<strong>her willingness to&nbsp;explain the logic behind her decisions, instead of&nbsp;just telling her child “Because I&nbsp;said&nbsp;so.”</strong> However, she also admits to&nbsp;getting carried away and breaking into “monologues” after he&nbsp;asked one question.</p><p>She reveals that she gave Julian important advice about the internet, saying “That stuff’s there forever. You’re gonna look back at&nbsp;this stuff and you’re gonna&nbsp;go, ‘Oh my&nbsp;God, I&nbsp;can do&nbsp;so&nbsp;much better than that now,’ and you might be&nbsp;embarrassed.” And when her son told her she was right, she considered that her proudest mommy moment.</p><p><h2>5. She talked with other parents about their kids’ situations.</h2></p><p><strong>The actress’s first </strong><a href=#><strong>rule</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;parenting is&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;know other parents</strong>. In&nbsp;her case, she felt that kids were scrutinized by&nbsp;adults too much, to&nbsp;the point that they are not allowed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through something. And fortunately, she was able to&nbsp;discuss this issue with other mothers.</p><p><h2>6. She managed to&nbsp;keep their family life private.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>article</a> by&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>, Kudrow talks about the dangers of&nbsp;social media. “You think you’re controlling the story. But when you put it&nbsp;out there, any individual can perceive it&nbsp;the way they want and they’ve got the same forum you&nbsp;do. <strong>Personal relationships, family, marriage, that stuff is&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;have very private parts, and it’s worth protecting</strong>,” she said. And for someone who values privacy this much, it’s no&nbsp;surprise that Kudrow rarely posts family photos on&nbsp;her Instagram.</p><p><h2>7. She guided Julian when he&nbsp;expressed interest in&nbsp;show business.</h2></p><p>When Julian began showing <a href=#>interest</a> in&nbsp;acting, Kudrow supported him on&nbsp;the condition that he&nbsp;stuck to&nbsp;school plays and amateur productions until he&nbsp;was old enough to&nbsp;enter show business. Kudrow said her son still needed more life experiences, and she also feared that <strong>having fame and power at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age might end up&nbsp;a&nbsp;disaster.</strong></p><p><h2>8. She raised an&nbsp;independent son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7cf/5e6/9d1d8e54cfa83c19b62efd2ed0.png><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2018 Jimmy Kimmel <a href=#>interview</a>, Kudrow said she felt like she did a&nbsp;good job injecting Julian with “the right amount of&nbsp;fear and caution.” As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, <strong>he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;independent and good man.</strong></p><p>She also <a href=#>shared</a> the challenge of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;protective mom, and figuring out when to&nbsp;let her kid do&nbsp;his own thing. In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;parenting roles, Kudrow revealed that she had her own rules and boundaries, but it&nbsp;was mostly her husband who was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the discipline.</p><p><h2>9. She promised to&nbsp;be&nbsp;supportive of&nbsp;Julian’s love life.</h2></p><p>When <a href=#>asked</a> about Julian having girlfriends, Kudrow answered with “I&nbsp;think I’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cheerleader for his girlfriends, though. I&nbsp;can’t imagine him bringing home someone horrible.” <strong>Her confidence in&nbsp;her son’s choices definitely shows how much she trusts him.</strong></p><p><h2>10. She’s not shy about expressing how much she loves Julian and how proud she is&nbsp;of&nbsp;him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f5/3b6/bf31955caa93795a0c095d697b.jpg><p>She rarely gives&nbsp;us a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;her personal life, but from time to&nbsp;time, <strong>Kudrow takes the opportunity to&nbsp;express her happiness and love for Julian</strong>&nbsp;— who by&nbsp;now, looks like her carbon copy. She shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>screenshot</a> of&nbsp;her FaceTime with him during his birthday. And she celebrated a&nbsp;milestone in&nbsp;his life by&nbsp;captioning his graduation <a href=#>photo</a> with “Happy proud HAPPY. And a&nbsp;little crying. By&nbsp;me&nbsp;not him.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: Julian had a&nbsp;touching message for his mom on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;Friends: The Reunion.</h2></p><p>Kudrow <a href=#>disclosed</a> in&nbsp;her interview with O’Brien that Julian visited the set when they filmed <i>Friends: The Reunion. </i>Afterward, her son approached her and said, “I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;awkward or&nbsp;inappropriate. Can I&nbsp;say that I’m really proud of&nbsp;you?”&nbsp;— yet more proof that Kudrow is&nbsp;absolutely nailing the parenting game.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;Lisa Kudrow’s parenting points do&nbsp;you relate to&nbsp;the most? What other advice about motherhood would you like to&nbsp;share?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmqv8Bmoq6coqTEtHnSqKVmrJikwqi002ahnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bsPArGShoaNiurC5jJqlnWVpYrqwvsRmq6GhnpzAbsPEZqOorpVirqO71K1koZ2iYr2ivsSnq6Kml2LAtcXLnmRxaGJmhnp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./humans-canceled-after-three-seasons-at-amc-channel-4-1203221291.html><span>←</span><span>Humans Canceled After Three Seasons at AMC, Channel 4</span></a>
