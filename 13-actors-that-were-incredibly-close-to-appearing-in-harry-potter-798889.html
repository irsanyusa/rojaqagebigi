<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>13 Actors That Were Incredibly Close to Appearing in Harry Potter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When we&nbsp;watch a&nbsp;<a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a>, especially a&nbsp;saga that really captures our attention, it’s hard to&nbsp;imagine those characters donning different faces. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;these particular actors who bring these characters to&nbsp;life remain forever linked to&nbsp;them in&nbsp;our memory. Just trying to&nbsp;imagine our favorite heroes or&nbsp;villains being played by&nbsp;someone else evokes a&nbsp;strange feeling. Still, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;face the fact that directors had more than one actor to&nbsp;choose from when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;casting parts. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe, they could have easily chosen someone else to&nbsp;play <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> or&nbsp;Hermione. But in&nbsp;this one, they didn’t.</p><p>So, here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;thought it’d be&nbsp;fun to&nbsp;see what the cast of&nbsp;the Harry Potter franchise would have looked like if&nbsp;directors went for other choices while casting, and this is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;found. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we&nbsp;also have a&nbsp;bonus feature about Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them.</p><p><h2>1. Tim Roth turned down the offer to&nbsp;play Severus Snape because he&nbsp;didn’t feel ready for the role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e67/7a6/172f8b5a4badf7a4f09ac5bc07.jpg><p>Severus Snape is&nbsp;a&nbsp;key character in&nbsp;the Harry Potter saga, and we&nbsp;pretty much all know that he&nbsp;stole everybody’s hearts. Because we&nbsp;have seen him from beginning to&nbsp;end in&nbsp;all the movies, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;imagine anyone but Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. However, Tim Roth was originally intended to&nbsp;play this character. The actor <a href=#>turned down</a> the offer because he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;wasn’t ready to&nbsp;get involved in&nbsp;the project.</p><p><h2>2. Hatty Jones could have been Hermione Granger, but she was a&nbsp;little too old to&nbsp;play the character.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b27/b1c/a732a459289267ed7f6822925a.jpg><p>Before <a href=# title="Emma Watson" data-link=tag>Emma Watson</a>, the actress chosen to&nbsp;play the book-loving witch and Harry Potter’s best friend was <a href=#>Hatty Jones</a>. Back in&nbsp;1998, she played Madeline in&nbsp;the movie of&nbsp;the same name. At&nbsp;first, the producers thought she was a&nbsp;good choice. However, they later thought that she was a&nbsp;bit too old to&nbsp;play Hermione so&nbsp;they chose Emma Watson who was only 9&nbsp;years old back then.</p><p><h2>3. Naomi Watts almost became Draco Malfoy’s mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ed/39a/76106c567eb698bbeefea63305.jpg><p>Initially, the role of&nbsp;Draco Malfoy’s mother was rumored to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;English actress, Naomi Watts. Although she’s not even close to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;leading role, she does have some appearances that are key to&nbsp;the story. However, when the <a href=#>actress</a> heard she was being considered, she admitted that she heard about it&nbsp;through the media, not from an&nbsp;agent, suggesting she was never seriously considered.</p><p><h2>4. Ray Winstone could have played Alastor Moody, but he&nbsp;turned down the role because the filming would take too long.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3c/eb9/3048d551ac9ab2fbc5b880ca60.jpg><p>Ray Winstone was the production’s first choice to&nbsp;play Alastor Moody, a&nbsp;character also known as&nbsp;Mad-Eye. However, as&nbsp;the actor himself <a href=#>confessed</a>, one of&nbsp;the main reasons he&nbsp;rejected the role was because he&nbsp;considered it&nbsp;not profitable enough given the large amount of&nbsp;time he&nbsp;would take to&nbsp;film. As&nbsp;the actor very clearly put&nbsp;it, his main reason to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor was to&nbsp;“make a&nbsp;living” out of&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>5. Kate Winslet’s agent rejected the offer for her to&nbsp;play Helena Ravenclaw.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e3/f2f/20d052587595bd5a0c7b024dc3.jpg><p><a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a>, known worldwide thanks to&nbsp;her performance in&nbsp;Titanic, is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;winner of&nbsp;several prestigious awards. Initially, she had been thought of&nbsp;to&nbsp;play the modest role of&nbsp;the ghost of&nbsp;Helena Ravenclaw. Although she is&nbsp;not one of&nbsp;the main characters, she does have a&nbsp;very important role in&nbsp;the destruction of&nbsp;Lord Voldemort. Still, the actress didn’t even make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the casting office since <a href=#>her manager</a> turned the job down right away.</p><p><h2>6. Hugh Grant had another film project coming&nbsp;up, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;couldn’t play Gilderoy Lockhart.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c9/9a8/6fc1ca5ba89880ea662ffea8fe.jpg><p>Although Professor Gilderoy Lockhart turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;phony, we&nbsp;can’t deny that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important character. Plus, he&nbsp;gives a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;fun and fanfare to&nbsp;the second installment of&nbsp;the saga. The first actor that director Chris Columbus thought of&nbsp;to&nbsp;play this role was Hugh Grant. However, he&nbsp;<a href=#>turned down</a> the job because of&nbsp;other work commitments.</p><p><h2>7. Rosamund Pike rejected the role of&nbsp;Rita Skeeter when she learned it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;minor role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/159/68a/2403b352c1a31227a0882a6997.jpg><p>Initially, actress <a href=#>Rosamund Pike</a> accepted the role of&nbsp;Rita Skeeter, a&nbsp;journalist who loves gossip and intrigue and who appears for the first time in&nbsp;the fourth installment of&nbsp;the saga. However, when she learned that she would also participate in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire, she turned down the job, as&nbsp;she was not interested in&nbsp;acting in&nbsp;both films in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;small role. That’s how Miranda Richardson got the role.</p><p><h2>8. Rosie O’Donnell was willing to&nbsp;play Molly Weasley but didn’t make the cut since she wasn’t English.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/619/cda/45337050438b11f64b7c232baa.jpg><p>Actress Rosie O’Donnell was interested in&nbsp;playing the role of&nbsp;Ron Weasley’s good-natured mother. However, just as&nbsp;with other actors who were willing to&nbsp;bring characters from the books to&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the movies, she didn’t make the cut since she wasn’t <a href=#>English</a>.</p><p><h2>9. The role of&nbsp;Sybill Trelawney was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;Tilda Swinton, but she simply did not like Harry Potter, so&nbsp;she declined the offer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d7/4f0/562553512eb6dddf871fa9f7d2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Tilda Swinton’s case, things were a&nbsp;bit different. She was offered a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;play the role of&nbsp;Professor Sybill Trelawney in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of&nbsp;Azkaban. Trelawney, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;teacher at&nbsp;Hogwarts, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;key figure in&nbsp;the unfolding of&nbsp;the story. Still, Swinton <a href=#>rejected</a> the role. She later admitted she <a href=#>disliked</a> Harry Potter for romanticizing boarding schools.</p><p><h2>10. It&nbsp;was widely suspected that Richard E. Grant would play the dubious Lucius Malfoy, but he&nbsp;actually wasn’t even aware of&nbsp;the rumor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/277/4dd/df93c95032b46bbda47b5e3d6a.jpg><p>When the filming of&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Chamber of&nbsp;Secrets was about to&nbsp;begin, Richard E. Grant was <a href=#>considered to&nbsp;play</a> the part of&nbsp;Draco Malfoy’s evil father, but it&nbsp;never ended up&nbsp;happening.</p><p><h2>11. David Thewlis originally auditioned to&nbsp;play Quirinus Quirrell.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f38/514/a4e85354f7b503dd0a8bfe0c48.jpg><p>Actor David Thewlis was interested in&nbsp;playing a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;the Harry Potter saga since the very beginning. He&nbsp;<a href=#>auditioned</a> for the role of&nbsp;Professor Quirrell but was not chosen. Although Ian Hart was picked to&nbsp;bring Quirrell to&nbsp;the big screen, Thewlis later did get the role of&nbsp;Remus Lupin who was also a&nbsp;teacher at&nbsp;Hogwarts.</p><p><h2>12. Robin Williams was very enthusiastic about playing Hagrid.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb9/a89/ce5be0582897d7c901cc6ea86b.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;Harry’s caring ranger and faithful friend, Rubeus Hagrid, there are many rumors about how producers weighed in&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>have Robin Williams</a> play the part. But in&nbsp;the end, they only wanted English actors, and Robbie Coltrane got the job.</p><p><h2>13. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for his nationality, Liam Aiken would’ve played Harry Potter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c6/256/3d42015b449bb5e5766d36f017.jpg><p>It’s very difficult to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the main character of&nbsp;the saga being played by&nbsp;someone other than Daniel Radcliffe. Well, brace yourself because originally, Liam Aiken was thought of&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring the wizard boy to&nbsp;life. As&nbsp;in&nbsp;the other casting cases, Aiken was <a href=#>rejected</a> because, according to&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;the books, only British actors could take part in&nbsp;the movie adaptations.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Nicholas Hoult was going to&nbsp;play Newt Scamander in&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them, but the director changed his mind.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca9/ce6/43416b54be920596b3f1c1f87f.jpg><p>Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them is&nbsp;not part of&nbsp;the original saga, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Harry Potter universe. Some of&nbsp;the characters of&nbsp;the movie even appear in&nbsp;both the Harry Potter movies and the prequel. The protagonist of&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them is&nbsp;wizard and magizoologist Newt Scamander. At&nbsp;first, the idea was for <a href=#>Nicholas Hoult</a> to&nbsp;play the part. But in&nbsp;the end, director David Yates felt that Eddie Redmayne was the most suitable for the role.</p><p>Can you imagine any of&nbsp;these actors playing the characters in&nbsp;the Harry Potter movies? Do&nbsp;you think they would’ve given a&nbsp;good performance or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you prefer the actual cast?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH50ecCcq6iqo2LBqa3TZq6eqpVitq%2Bv0Z6bopqcrnqkuM6snGasn2KusbzEmqmippditq95x5qpq7Fdpby1wMSrZHBxaG2Fens%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-ocd-anxiety.html><span>←</span><span>What Does It Mean to Have OCD?
