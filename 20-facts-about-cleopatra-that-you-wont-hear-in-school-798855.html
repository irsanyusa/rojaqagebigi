Her full name was Cleopatra VII, which means that <strong>she was the <a href=#>seventh</a> woman with this name </strong>in&nbsp;the family of&nbsp;Egyptian pharaohs.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the philosopher, Plutarch, Cleopatra <a href=#>didn’t have </a>outstanding beauty the way she’s often portrayed in&nbsp;movies.

She was 5&nbsp;feet tall, and <a href=#>plump</a>, according to&nbsp;today’s beauty standards.</p><p><h2>Her beauty secrets became legends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e67/077/65cdaf554a8f62ca888d709d93.png><p>Cleopatra’s image is&nbsp;popular, even today. Marketing professionals promote beauty products by&nbsp;saying that Cleopatra used to&nbsp;use them. These are some of&nbsp;her best-known beauty secrets:</p><ul readability=11.149882903981><li readability=1.7697841726619><p>According to&nbsp;legends, she’d take baths with warm <a href=#>donkey milk</a> and <a href=#>honey</a> for her complexion. However, historians have never confirmed&nbsp;it.</p></li><li readability=3.8681318681319><p><strong>Cleopatra’s famous black eyeliner arrows were not for decoration</strong>, but for health. They <a href=#>helped</a> her to&nbsp;avoid eye infections that were quite common in&nbsp;those days. Cleopatra’s eye makeup was made with kohl. It&nbsp;contained substances that prevented the development of&nbsp;such diseases. However, kohl’s lead content has caused it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>banned</a> in&nbsp;the modern age.</p></li><li readability=3.8755555555556><p>When recreating Cleopatra’s makeup, most of&nbsp;our contemporaries use gold or&nbsp;nude colors. However, the queen <a href=#>painted </a>her lips and cheeks bright red. For this, she used red ochre which was finely ground and mixed with water.</p></li><li readability=6.9490909090909><p>To&nbsp;keep her skin soft and clear, Cleopatra may have <a href=#>used</a> rose water as&nbsp;a&nbsp;toner. Even William Shakespeare wrote about the queen’s affinity for rose water in&nbsp;Anthony and Cleopatra. Surprisingly, to&nbsp;this day, this ingredient can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;most tonics and cleansers. You can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;yourself: just place the rose petals in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pot of&nbsp;water and bring it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;boil. Once the petals have lost most of&nbsp;their color, turn off the stove and let the beauty potion cool. If&nbsp;you’d like, you can add a&nbsp;few drops of&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;E to&nbsp;the substance.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/920/f5d/f37fc8579db5bbd8bd34fb7e45.jpg><ul readability=1.8338108882521><li readability=0><p>Cleopatra <a href=#>used</a> henna as&nbsp;natural nail polish which gave her fingernails a&nbsp;lovely reddish-brown color.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Diet was also important to&nbsp;Cleopatra.

Her knowledge of&nbsp;literature, art, politics, and philosophy amazed her interlocutors. She was amazingly graceful and could perfectly play the lute and harp, and she also sang and danced. Additionally, <strong>Cleopatra <a href=#>knew</a> multiple languages</strong>, even becoming the first Ptolemaic ruler to&nbsp;learn the native Egyptian language, so&nbsp;she rarely used translators, communicating with foreigners directly.</p><p>Once, when there was a&nbsp;rebellion and the Queen had to&nbsp;<a href=#>leave </a>Alexandria. However, Caesar arrived at&nbsp;the capital, and she needed to&nbsp;meet with him in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;put down the rebellion. To&nbsp;walk through the angry crowd, Cleopatra was bound inside a&nbsp;bed sack to&nbsp;be&nbsp;smuggled into the palace to&nbsp;meet Caesar. Struck by&nbsp;her cunning, the Roman emperor fell madly in&nbsp;love with her.</p><p>Later, following Caesar’s order, Cleopatra’s golden statue was <a href=#>placed</a> in&nbsp;the Temple of&nbsp;Venus, and she was worshipped as&nbsp;a&nbsp;goddess.</p><p><h2>She won the hearts of&nbsp;the most influential men of&nbsp;her time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05c/823/aa760253dd87400b09a61c297d.jpg><p>Later, Romans began to&nbsp;think that Caesar wanted to&nbsp;<a href=#>declare</a> Cleopatra’s son his heir. According to&nbsp;some rumors, this led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>conspiracy</a> against him which resulted in&nbsp;Caesar’s tragic death.</p><p>Cleopatra realized that she could <a href=#>remain</a> the Queen of&nbsp;Egypt only if&nbsp;she could seduce Mark Antony, especially hoping he&nbsp;could help her produce heirs. She decided to&nbsp;win the heart of&nbsp;this Roman general by&nbsp;all means. Cleopatra knew that Mark Antony thought of&nbsp;himself as&nbsp;the Greek god, Dionysus, and in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;impress him, she decided to&nbsp;play along with&nbsp;it. She appeared in&nbsp;the city dressed like the Greek goddess Aphrodite. The general fell in&nbsp;love with her immediately.</p><p>Her contemporaries said that <strong>Cleopatra’s <a href=#>behavior</a> with Mark Antony was different from how she acted with Caesar</strong>. With the Roman emperor, she was always witty, charming, and graceful, and she talked about art, literature, and politics. But with Mark Antony, she behaved like a&nbsp;courtesan: she played dice and even participated in&nbsp;hunts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83b/b09/8fe6eb55a1933d95ad0b6adab4.jpg><p>Mark Antony, who was madly in&nbsp;love with her, did anything she wanted. He&nbsp;even <strong><a href=#>divorced</a> his wife, </strong>Octavia.</p><p><h2>Cleopatra loved to&nbsp;shock others and keep her environment interesting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b47/b9b/35ed07545499dcc8e05006a73c.jpg><ul><li>Queen Cleopatra studied mathematics, astronomy, rhetoric, and philosophy. She <a href=#>was</a> the only representative of&nbsp;her dynasty who adopted Egyptian religion and was interested in&nbsp;the culture of&nbsp;Egypt. Before her reign, the Ptolemaic were not interested in&nbsp;the gods and customs of&nbsp;their people.</li><li>Cleopatra had a&nbsp;wonderful sense of&nbsp;humor. She and Mark Antony <strong><a href=#>formed</a> their own society known as&nbsp;the “Inimitable Livers.”</strong> The group engaged in&nbsp;nightly feasts and wine binges. The Queen and Mark Antony loved to&nbsp;wander the streets of&nbsp;Alexandria in&nbsp;disguise and play pranks on&nbsp;its residents.</li><li>The Queen <a href=#>had </a>children from both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Caesar’s son’s name was Caesarion. With Mark Antony, she had twins, Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene&nbsp;II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus.</li><li>Cleopatra was sure that scents could be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tool of&nbsp;persuasion and she even had her own <a href=#>perfume factory</a>. It&nbsp;even had an&nbsp;early spa.</li></ul><p><h2>Cleopatra was the last ruler of&nbsp;her dynasty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d10/f96/a98842502891c75e6feb42cf82.jpg><p>The brother of&nbsp;Mark Antony’s ex-wife, Octavian, decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;war with Egypt. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;win the war, and the Egyptian queen fell into despair. She then learned that she would be&nbsp;paraded in&nbsp;chains during Octavian’s triumph. Cleopatra <a href=#>said</a>, “<b>I&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;led in&nbsp;triumph!</b>”</p><p>On&nbsp;her last day, she threw a&nbsp;gorgeous feast for the winners. During this feast, she left for her bedroom. According to&nbsp;one version of&nbsp;the story, she <a href=#>took</a> poison, and according to&nbsp;another, she pricked a&nbsp;snake so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;would bite her.</p><p>Cleopatra became the last queen of&nbsp;Egypt. Her death coincided with the decline of&nbsp;Egypt’s greatness, and the once-mighty empire turned into one of&nbsp;the Roman provinces. Her life was full of&nbsp;intriguing twists and turns and was so&nbsp;bright and unusual that Cleopatra is&nbsp;remembered and revered to&nbsp;this day.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Cleopatra?
