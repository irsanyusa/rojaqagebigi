Kate Middleton, the Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge, recently faced criticism from online trolls after a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;her from Remembrance Sunday was posted by&nbsp;British Vogue.

However, many people came to&nbsp;her defense, praising her for aging gracefully and rejecting the ageist narrative perpetuated by&nbsp;the trolls.
Many defend her authenticity.

This is&nbsp;obviously stress showing on&nbsp;her face,” drawing attention to&nbsp;the subjective nature of&nbsp;age and the toll that stress can take on&nbsp;one’s appearance.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>StubHub Sued for Illegally Boosting Profits With Deceptive Pricing and Junk Fees in Washington</h2><time>Jun 11, 2024</time>

What do you think about the following statement?
“According to me, salmon sashimi is the most delicious food in the world.”
Does it sound okay to you, or is there something a bit awkward about it?&nbsp;
While the grammar in this statement is technically correct, it’s not a totally natural way to express this idea. In English, it’s unusual to use “according to me” when you’re stating your own thoughts or opinions.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Patch Adams</h2><time>Jun 10, 2024</time>

But who’s likely to win the ninth generation when the PS5 and Xbox Series X are released in winter of this year? YouGov data reveals that Sony’s PlayStation 5 (PS5) is clearly ahead in terms of purchase interest: a third (34%) of UK gamers are either interested in buying the device or definitely intend to buy the device within the first 12 months of release – rising to 56% of those who use a games console – compared to just 20% for the Xbox Series X (rising to 36% of console gamers overall).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>When No One Is Watching: The 100 Best Mystery and Thriller Books</h2><time>Jun 10, 2024</time>
