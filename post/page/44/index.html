Dorling Kindersley / Getty Images New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is hoping city residents will drink a lot less this summer — less soda, that is.
On Wednesday the famously public health-focused mayor proposed a ban on the sale of large-sized sugar-sweetened beverages — that includes sodas, sweetened teas and coffees, energy drinks and fruit drinks. If approved, the proposal, which is slated to take effect as early as next March, would prohibit restaurants, delis, sports arena vendors, movie theaters and food carts regulated by the city health department from selling sugary beverages in sizes larger than 16 oz.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>CM Punk AEW Debut Draws Over 1 Million Viewers in Friday Ratings</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../how-to-become-spiritual.html></a>
Last May, my brother died from unintentional drug overdose. It was a major loss, the greatest heartbreak of my life. But when you’re a spiritual person and someone you love becomes an angel, you actually have access to a totally new relationship.
Now, my brother and I connect daily. I joke that we talk more now than we did when he was here, and in a way, it’s true. When I need a little extra magic (to find a parking spot or the right words for a speech), I call on my brother.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Howard Hughes (Aviator and Businessman)</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../howard-hughes.html></a>
Profession: Aviator and Businessman
Biography: Howard Hughes is known for his eccentricities as much as for his achievements, which were many. Hughes was a Hollywood filmmaker, an aviator, real estate mogul and philanthropist.
Hughes' enormous wealth originated from his father's invention of a drill bit used in oil drilling. Arriving in Hollywood in 1926 he funded and produced such films as Hell's Angels (1927), Scarface (1934) and The Outlaws (1943), which made a star out of Jane Russell.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kentucky Derby: The Best Health Excuse For That Mint Julep</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

The Kentucky Derby is this Saturday, and that means mint juleps will be on the menu. While there’s really no great health benefit imparted by bourbon, mint certainly has its qualities. If nutrition is what your after, mint soaked in booze may not be the best source, but if you need an excuse for a second mint julep, we’ve got a few.
“Without a doubt, the mojito is my favorite way to enjoy the fresh flavor of mint, but it’s mint in its natural state that I truly love,” says registered dietitian Tina Ruggiero.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Louis XIII (King of France)</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

Profession: King of France
Biography: Louis XIII, sometimes called Louis the Just, became King of France in 1610 upon the assassination of his father, Henry IV. He ruled until his death in 1643, although until 1617 his mother—Marie de' Medici—ruled in his stead as he was only eight at the time of his father's death. Though Louis was still yet young in 1617, his mother's rule had been characterised by mismanagement and harmful intrigues.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rodrigo Duterte by Caesar Gaviria: TIME 100</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>

“Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now there are 3 million drug addicts. I’d be happy to slaughter them,” Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ President, has said. His approach is as ill considered as his grasp of history (more than half of Hitler’s 11 million victims were Jewish). Since Duterte’s inauguration last year, some 7,000 people have been killed. His ironfisted strategy alarms governments, human-rights organizations and faith-based groups while winning high approval ratings at home.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The possessive pronouns in German: How to find the right form</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../possessive-pronouns-german.html></a>
Possessive pronouns – think: mine, ours, hers, his, etc. – can replace a noun or accompany it. However you use them, possessive pronouns indicate a relation with a noun (what or who belongs to someone or something). They are short, clever helpers that make conversation easier and more precise. And that goes for German, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Learning possessive pronouns in German might look like a lot of work and can also be a bit intimidating.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'American Idol's Catie Turner Debuts Emotional Song 'God Must Hate Me'</h2><time>Jul 21, 2024</time>
