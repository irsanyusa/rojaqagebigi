Democratic sentiment toward the Confederate flag has shifted more in the past month than it had in the five years prior, a change that new polling suggests is largely fueled by President Donald Trump’s lonely defense of the Southern relic.
In a new Morning Consult/Politico survey, 39 percent of voters said they mostly see the displaying of the Stars and Bars as a symbol of racism, up 3 percentage points since early June and a record high in Morning Consult polling.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eddie Murphy Says Hes Already Recorded Some of Shrek 5 and I Think Its Coming O</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>
