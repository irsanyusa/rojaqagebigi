<a href=../../../dna-transgender-history.html></a>
Science is too busy holding the universe together to care about politics. Greenhouse gases will continue contributing to climate change and vaccines will continue not causing autism, whether you believe it or not.
None of that means that politicians and ideologues won’t keep trying to drag science into their fights. The latest example of this unlovely truth occurred just this week, when the New York Times reported the existence of a memo drafted by the Department of Health and Human Services that would, if the changes it details were implemented, effectively roll back civil protections for transgender people by defining gender as a fixed biological trait, determined by genitalia at birth.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>10 green flags women ignore in men when watching out for red flags</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>

However, in the pursuit of avoiding the negatives, it's equally crucial for ladies to be attuned to the often-overlooked green flags that signal positive attributes in men. Respectful communication While red flags may include poor communication or disrespectful language, green flags involve men who consistently communicate respectfully. ADVERTISEMENT
A partner who actively listens, values your opinions, and communicates openly and honestly is displaying a key green flag.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Aladdin Broadway Musical Review | TIME</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../aladdin-broadway-show-review.html></a>
The six-year-old who accompanied me to the theater was enthralled. Plenty of adults, too, were on their feet, and not just for the obligatory standing ovation at the final curtain. Even the critics, reviewing the new musical Aladdin, seemed to temper their usual disdain for all things Disney and lavish praise. Maybe Disney is finally getting some respect.
Ever since The Lion King — the one show everyone agreed was great — the stage musicals that Disney has adapted from its animated movie musicals, no matter how crowd-pleasing, have been greeted by most of the critics with dyspeptic concern for the fate of the American theater.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Crown S6: Queen Elizabeth Celebrates VE Day</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../the-crown-season-6-queen-ve-day.html></a>
If you’re watching the sixth and final season of The Crown and wondering whether Queen Elizabeth really did sneak out of Buckingham Palace and dance with commoners to celebrate the end of World War II, the answer is…yes. Yes, she did. In the eighth episode, titled “The Ritz,” the young then Princess Elizabeth (Viola Prettejohn) joins her sister Princess Margaret out dancing on V-E day on May 8, 1945, which marked the end of World War II in Europe.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Overlooked Solar Power Potential of U.S. Parking Lots</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../solar-parking-lots-france-us.html></a>
For climate campaigners, French parking lots are now very exciting places.
In November, France’s senate approveda law which would require the owners of almost all large parking lots to install solar panels. They would have to cover 50% of the lots’ surface area by 2028—or face a heavy monthly fine. If the legislation passes as expected in its final reading at the National Assembly in December, the French government expects it will add 11 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity to the national grid.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>un printemps &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot;, un t encore indcis</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
