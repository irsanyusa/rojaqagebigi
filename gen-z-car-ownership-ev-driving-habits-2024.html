<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>A Data Deep Dive On Gen Z Driving and Transportation Behaviors</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pro-assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2024/08/Auto-Mobility_Dealership-Feature-Image-576x324.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Compared to the general population, Gen Z adults are more likely to live in urban areas, be students, be unmarried and be without kids — all things that make driving less of a necessity. But also all things that were true of previous generations in their youth. What really differentiates the Gen Z driving dynamic (or lack thereof) is the extent to which digital experiences control their day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though Gen Zers are less likely than all U.S. adults to be employed full-time, those who do work are more likely than all U.S. adults to do so remotely, lessening the need for a commute. Plus, they’re voracious users of transportation services like ride-share and meal delivery: Nearly 3 in 5 (58%) regularly use the latter — that’s 19 percentage points higher than the average consumer.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In short, Gen Zers’ spend <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>much of their days</a> at home on their phones and computers, where, rather ironically, content around another, more humble mode of transport — walking — tends to thrive.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fitness gurus <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>endlessly tout</a> the benefits of hitting 10,000 steps per day. Influencers document their “<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>hot girl walks</a>.” Walking pads are one of the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>most viral products</a> on TikTok. Urban planners are even <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>accumulating</a> large followings for discussing the importance of walkable cities.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But Gen Zers aren’t just watching people talk about walking; they’re actually walking, too. Two-thirds (67%) of the young cohort cite walking as their primary fitness activity.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while the circumstances, technologies and fixations that shape the contours of daily life for Gen Z will continue to inform their relationship to driving, it is, again, almost inevitable that their car ownership will increase with age. However, one automotive market segment may see little benefit: electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Fizzling EV enthusiasm</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The share of Gen Z adults who expressed interest in owning an electric car steadily declined from 52% in June 2022 to 42% in June 2024. Meanwhile, the share who said they had no desire to own an electric car grew almost equally, from 41% to 48%, during the same period. Similar movements were not observed among all U.S. adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">What’s more, Gen Z adults continued to report stable levels of interest in environmentally-conscious shopping habits, suggesting their decline in enthusiasm for EVs is not the product of a broader anti-environment movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5yyr3nZZpqaql2kxK%2Bx0ayfoqhdmsNusNGiraKml2K1oq7IrapmamBngQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-things-you-can-do-for-fun-on-boxing-day.html><span>←</span><span>5 things you can do for fun on Boxing Day</span></a>
