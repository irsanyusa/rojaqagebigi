<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Lloyds Co-op deal collapse reverberates on social media</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>On April 24 it was announced that the planned sale of 631 UK bank branches by Lloyds Banking group to the Co-op group had fallen through.</p><p>After more than a year of discussions, the Co-op pulled out from a deal that would have created a 974-strong branch network (three times its current size) and made it the seventh biggest bank in Britain. This would have increased competition amongst Britain’s high street banks. However, the Co-op blamed the continued economic downturn and tougher regulations imposed on banks as the reason why it was unable to complete the transaction.</p><p>Using YouGov’s social media analysis tool, SoMA, we can see a noticeable increase in reach on both Twitter and Facebook on the date of this announcement.</p><p>The total UK Twitter population who heard about the Co-op jumped from 3.2% and 5.7% on April 22 and 23 respectively, to 40.1% on April 24.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Coop.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Similarly, we can see that the number of people on Facebook who heard about the Co-op almost doubled from 1.5% on April 23 to 2.9% on April 24. Whilst this increase is not as considerable as on Twitter, the much greater UK Facebook population means that this increase is indeed significant.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/coop2.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Using SoMA we can see that the most popular words mentioned alongside Co-op on this day included “Lloyds”, “branches”, “deal”, “bank”, “sale” and “collapses”. Therefore, we are in no doubt that the news about the collapsed sale of Lloyds TSB branches to the Co-op is the reason behind the spike in the number of people on Twitter and Facebook who had heard about the brand.</p><p>SoMA also enables us to measure the demographic audiences that heard about the Co-op on both Twitter and Facebook. Most notably, on Twitter 59% of those who had heard about the Co-op were male, while on Facebook 53% of those who had heard about the Co-op were female. Similar analysis can also be performed on region, age and income brackets. For example, younger people were more likely to have heard about the Co-op on Twitter, with a 14% reach of those aged 18 to 24 (compared to 10% on Facebook); whereas older people were more likely to have heard about the Co-op on Facebook, with a 23% reach of those aged 55 and over on Facebook (compared to 16% on Twitter).</p><p>This analysis highlights the growing power of social media in the impact of a news story. As well as indicating what is heard, SoMA also offers crucial insights into what demographic audiences heard about the Co-op on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p><a href=#>Learn more about SoMA</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZW5%2Bd3nLpaaynKNisLB5zqlknZ2RoXqku8ulmKmrlWK%2FpsLEq5meqpGpsrR50qiaopmcYrqmsA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-kudrows-son-thought-jennifer-aniston-was-his-mom-and-9-more-things-we-love-about-her-parenting-style-802199.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Kudrows Son Thought Jennifer Aniston Was His Mom, and 9 More Things We Love About Her Parent</span></a>
