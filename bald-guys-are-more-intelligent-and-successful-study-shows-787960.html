The researchers found that although people see men with hair as&nbsp;more physically attractive, bald men are more likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;having higher social status: people claimed that they see them as&nbsp;more dominant and superior, but they didn’t feel any threat in&nbsp;comparison to&nbsp;men with hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d7/c56/749ca158e1aac564ca30858391.jpg><p>During the research, Dr. Frank Muscarella asked the focus group to&nbsp;rate male participants in&nbsp;accordance with 4&nbsp;criteria: attractiveness, aggressiveness, appeasement, and maturity. Some people were shown the photos of&nbsp;men who had a&nbsp;head full of&nbsp;hair and the other part of&nbsp;the group saw the pictures of&nbsp;the same men but with their hair completely digitally removed. The results turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite unexpected: bald men were rated as&nbsp;more honest, intelligent, and masculine.</p><p><h2>Several studies have proven that these results are correct.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12f/2da/c3f1d2532cb9b660cba3168e05.jpg><p>The findings of&nbsp;Dr. Frank Muscarella were backed up&nbsp;by<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;research</a> from the University of&nbsp;Pennsylvania. Psychologist Albert E. Mannes proved that people tend to&nbsp;see bald men as&nbsp;stronger, more dominant, and successful.</p><p>But bald men are not just perceived as&nbsp;strong and sexy, they are seen as&nbsp;smart too. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Researchers </a>from the University of&nbsp;Saarland analyzed data based on&nbsp;the opinion poll of&nbsp;20,000&nbsp;people. The results showed that bald men are more often perceived as&nbsp;older, but people see them as&nbsp;wiser and more intelligent.</p><p><h2>Having bald spots and some hair won’t do&nbsp;the trick.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f98/55d/274325587098244a39ae8117b6.jpg><p>Men have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;completely bald in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perceived this way.<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> The research </a>showed that men who had bald spots, on&nbsp;the contrary, were perceived as&nbsp;weak and less masculine. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;the fact that shaving your head can be&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;an&nbsp;active statement, giving others a&nbsp;feeling that the man has the situation under control and isn’t ashamed of&nbsp;his appearance. And that is&nbsp;appealing!</p><p>Do&nbsp;you agree with the results of&nbsp;this study? Or&nbsp;maybe you can relate to&nbsp;it&nbsp;with your own personal experience?
