So the show is about just that—two black girlfriends navigating their love lives, jobs and each other. Right now, there is this need to portray black women on TV as strong, flawless and fierce. It's great to have that representation, but I wanted there to be a real, human portrayal. I've never seen two dark-skinned black girls in lead roles painted as regular people. I really just thought that would be cool to see.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=378><strong data-reactid=379>There is a lot of talk about the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Do you hope your show will help change that?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=380>Only in the way of it existing and people talking about how they like it. I'm not burdened by the racial strife of it all. I think that by way of existing, other shows with people of color won't have to focus on the struggle of race. They can just be two people falling in love or solving a crime. The statement that I want to make at the end of the day is just existing.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=382><strong data-reactid=383>You have said that Shonda Rhimes is a mentor. What has she taught you?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=384>There was a moment when I was scared to speak up. Everybody was behind this one decision, and I didn't want to rock the boat. Shonda told me about a time in her life where if she hadn't spoken up, her trajectory would have been different. She didn't know she could get fired—that's what gave her the confidence! So I try to operate with that same mentality.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=386><strong data-reactid=387>How have you developed your confidence?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 end text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=388>It comes from knowing that I am walking with purpose and doing what I love. I set out with a goal and am, little by little, achieving that. Everybody has doubts, but I try to embrace them. I'm always going to be afraid of failing, and now that I've attained some level of spotlight, that pressure has only gotten bigger. But I know that if that happens, I am just going to have to get back up—that is part of life. I can only live in the moment and realize that my insecurities make me who I am.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaJmdmr%2Bqr8CnZK%2BnmZiytHmRaWhwZ2RqhHV8kHJmmqWVp7akrc1mraihk5rAbrXSrJhmqpGafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lom-autorites-organisatrices-voyageurs-et-entreprises-appellent-une-adoption-avant-fin-2019.html><span>←</span><span>autorits organisatrices, voyageurs et entreprises appellent une adoption avant fin 2019</span></a>
