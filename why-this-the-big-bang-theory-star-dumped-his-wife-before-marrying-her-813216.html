The famous actor let his self-doubt get the best of&nbsp;him and broke up&nbsp;with Towne, even though all he&nbsp;really wanted was to&nbsp;propose.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;Helberg, “I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;marry this girl, so&nbsp;first of&nbsp;all, I’m going to&nbsp;systematically destroy my&nbsp;entire life and our relationship and lie and ruin all my&nbsp;friendships.” He&nbsp;added, “I&nbsp;freaked out, <strong>I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I had feelings for other people, I&nbsp;thought that&nbsp;I needed more of&nbsp;an&nbsp;exciting life.</strong> I&nbsp;had the perfect thing but for whatever reason. It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;exercise in&nbsp;self-destruction.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/912/8db/6ef8aa558e8e5368ad2714880b.jpg><p>AXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN.COM/East News</p><p>Helberg admitted that he&nbsp;got cold feet, which is&nbsp;very natural before taking a&nbsp;big step like marriage, but he&nbsp;couldn’t even bring himself to&nbsp;propose to&nbsp;Towne. Naturally, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> the breakup badly and decided to&nbsp;move back to&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a>, which led to&nbsp;her dating another man. So&nbsp;Helberg did the only thing that could salvage their relationship.</p><p>The actor flew to&nbsp;France and somehow convinced Towne to&nbsp;give him another chance. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “I&nbsp;proposed immediately on&nbsp;her return because&nbsp;I thought if&nbsp;I can just trap her and force her to&nbsp;marry me&nbsp;that’s the most romantic thing anyone could ask for.”</p><p><h2>Their marriage inspired his <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>storyline.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/337/a67/4357c2503790f86b5fd8f2803c.jpg><p>Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/East News<span>, </span>Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>After Helberg and Towne got married, they became <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>parents</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy and a&nbsp;girl, which <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> Helberg the first <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>cast member to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the showrunner decided to&nbsp;have his character find the love of&nbsp;his life quicker than the rest of&nbsp;the group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/426/86b/c973b75560803cc6d5cc5e94b5.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;now know, Helberg’s character, Howard, was known for striking out with the ladies but not losing hope in&nbsp;the love department. Eventually, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fell</a> for Melissa Rauch’s character, Bernadette. They became the first couple to&nbsp;marry on&nbsp;the show and, eventually, have children.</p><p><h2>Helberg also adapted his love story into a&nbsp;movie.</h2></p><p>But <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>wasn’t the only on-screen adaptation of&nbsp;Helberg and Towne’s love story. Helberg himself realized that their marriage story was perfect movie material and made it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>film</a> called <i>We’ll Never Have Paris</i>, which he&nbsp;directed with his wife.</p><p>Funnily enough, at&nbsp;first, Towne <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a> Helberg was crazy for letting the world know their love story, as&nbsp;she didn’t even tell her parents about the breakup. She felt it&nbsp;was too humiliating. In&nbsp;the end, however, when Helberg finished the script, his wife thought it&nbsp;was hilarious, and they completed the project together.</p><p>Interestingly, there’s even more drama hiding among <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>cast. For example, the on-screen couple, Penny and Leonard, portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Kaley Cuoco" data-link=tag>Kaley Cuoco</a> and Johnny Galecki, had a&nbsp;romantic relationship in&nbsp;real life. Cuoco and Galecki were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious <a href=#>relationship</a> for a&nbsp;few years while filming the show. Unfortunately, the couple didn’t work out, but they stayed great <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> and colleagues.</p><p>Preview photo credit USA TODAY Network/Sipa USA/East News<span>, </span>AXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN.COM/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYytn6KrXam1pnnBop5mmpGjtG7Ax56mq7FdqMGivoydrKaolZl6qbXSZq6inpVir6ayzqucZqWRp7%2B6tc2gZKGdomKFcn%2BRam1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./author.html><span>←</span><span>Sochi Suits Americas Top Female Skier</span></a>
