She taught herself to sew during her childhood in Utah, partly because she stood 6 feet tall and couldn’t find any clothes to fit her. Her clothes routinely won spots on Best Dressed lists, which made her a popular pick for first-time red carpet stars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She even won the approval of the notoriously hard-to-impress Vogue editor Anna Wintour. “L’Wren was a total perfectionist, someone who absolutely embodied everything her marvelous clothes stood for: strength of character combined with a confident and powerful style,” Wintour said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement.</a> “In person, L’Wren was always unbelievably generous, gracious, kind, and so much fun. Her old world American manners and charm were from another time, but her sensibility was always fiercely modern. We will all miss her.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sarah Jessica Parker</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lwren-scott-dresses-sarah-jessica-parker.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sarah Jessica Parker knows a thing or two about fashion, and the Sex & The City star regularly wore L’Wren Scott. In 2011, Parker <a href=# rel=noopener>said of Scott</a>, “I think L’Wren has an extraordinary ability to make dresses that genuinely flatter a woman. She makes an unbelievably contemporary dress in a remarkably old-fashioned way for all sorts of women and body types.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Parker, a frequent client of Scott’s, notably chose (from left) a gold fringed L’Wren Scott dress at the annual Serpentine Gallery Summer Party in London on June 26, 2013, a hot pink L’Wren Scott mini to the London premier of her film Did You Hear About The Morgans? on Dec. 8, 2009, and a skin tight black L’Wren Scott dress to the MTV Movie Awards on June 1, 2008.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Nicole Kidman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lwren-scott-dresses-nicole-kidman.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A long time friend of Scott’s, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kidman said</a>, “L’Wren and I have been dear friends for years now…She knows what aspects to accentuate in a woman, and is able to make you feel incredibly sexy and sophisticated when you are in one of her exquisite designs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kidman frequently wore Scott’s designs, most notably (from left) to the Rome Film Festival premiere of Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus in 2006, to the 81st Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles in 2009, and again to the Academy Awards in Hollywood in 2013.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Christina Hendricks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lwren-scott-dresses-christina-hendricks.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Mad Men star has turned to Scott’s designs often and <a href=# rel=noopener>said of the designer</a>, “L’Wren’s clothes make you feel like a sexy pin-up, a sophisticated lady and a rockstar all at once. She designs for how women want to look and for what men want to look at.” Many other fans echoed the point that Scott had a particularly good understanding of how clothes fit the body.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hendricks took two memorable turns in L’Wren Scott gowns, first at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sept. 20, 2009 (left), and more recently at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in West Hollywood, Calif, on March 2, 2014.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Michelle Obama</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lwren-scott-dresses-michelle-obama.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of Scott’s highest profile clients, U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama has become as famous for wearing L’Wren Scott as she is for wearing J.
