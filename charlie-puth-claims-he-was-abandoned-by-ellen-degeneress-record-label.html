According to him, the now-defunct label ghosted him after signing him up to work with them.</p><p>“Nobody was really present, certainly after the creation of my first, like, demo EP,” he said.</p><p>For those who may not know, DeGeneres launched eleveneleven record label in 2010 with talk show presenter Mile Hamlin. Meanwhile, Puth gained extreme traction in his YouTube channel when he covered Adele’s “Someone Like You” with Emily Luther. In 2011, the two sealed a record deal with eleveneleven to make and release new music.</p><p>“All the people that were in that room, they just disappeared,” Puth said. “I didn’t hear from anybody.”</p><p>Luckily, now, the “Left and Right” singer is under the care of a passionate label, Atlantic. Puth recently shared that his now label allows him to freely write music and deliver a full body of work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Charlie Puth, Greyson Chance Have Different Experiences</h2><p>Puth is not the first artist to ever allege Ellen DeGeneres’s record label business ethics. Greyson Chance also recently exposed the trauma he went through as a teenager due to DeGeneres’ degrading attitude. Like Puth, he was signed by the talk show star in her label and eventually got abandoned.</p><p>“I’ve never met someone more manipulative, more self-centered, and more blatantly opportunistic than her,” Chance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>However, Chance’s perspective differs from Puths, since Puth regards DeGeneres in a positive light. He claims that has not encountered any rude circumstance involving her. Nonetheless, he agreed on Chance’s claims that nobody was present to attend to his creative needs back then.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Doesn’t Pin the Blame on Just One Person</h2><p>Although the situation was terrible, Puth has made it clear that he’s not mad at DeGeneres. The “Light Switch” singer also believes that the mismanagement of the label wasn’t merely her fault. At the same time, the musician didn’t think that his early songs were great, since he lacked experience. In turn, he’s glad that those were not released.</p><p>“I realized that I’m capable of a lot of things, and making an album is one of them – and I’m gonna do this myself,” he said.</p><p>Puth hasn’t discussed this issue with DeGeneres herself, but he says that he’s not taking this bad experience against her. If anything, this record deal loss influenced him to be more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">intimate</a> with his music.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_JoJoSiwa_AveryCyrus_JoJoViaIG2.png alt="Avery Cyrus Asks JoJo Siwa to Be Her Girlfriend at Disney World" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGYq6SZmnqxwdOhZJykkZ66tHnHnmSwmaNirqOtzZ2mp52UYq%2B6ecSlo56mXZmyqLHNnqmeq6Niv6avzqubZqSRl7Ktew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-a-robot-ever-become-your-friend-816255.html><span>←</span><span>Can a Robot Ever Become Your Friend?</span></a>
