The RICO Act was originally put in place to target organized crime, <a href=# rel=noopener>per the U.S. Department of Justice</a>, but racketeering also applies to “egregious copyright infringement.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Shein has grown rich by committing individual infringements over and over again, as part of a long and continuous pattern of racketeering, which shows no sign of abating,” the filing said. “It is not an exaggeration to suggest that Shein’s pattern of misconduct involves commission of new copyright and trademark infringements every day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Small business owners <a href=# rel=noopener>have long spoken out</a> against the company for stealing designs, though complicated copyright law in the fashion industry has made it difficult to take legal action for copycat clothing designs.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response to the lawsuit, Shein <a href=# rel=noopener>told the AP</a> that it “takes all claims of infringement seriously, and we take swift action when complaints are raised by valid IP rights holders.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what to know about the case.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is Shein?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shein, the <a href=# rel=noopener>most-googleable fashion brand worldwide</a>, is a Chinese-based retailer that was founded in 2008. The company <a href=#>generated $100 billion</a> in sales in 2022, selling goods ranging from clothes to home decor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the company remains popular due to its affordable prices and quick jump on trends, that all comes at a price. Numerous investigations into Shein have tarnished its reputation into a brand that does not abide by labor regulations, with <a href=#>reports alleging</a> that workers have 75-hour shifts with limited time off, and that employees work in unsafe conditions without windows or emergency exits. The company has also come under fire for its poor environmental standards, producing about <a href=#>6.3 million tons of carbon dioxide</a> per year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shein recently made headlines for inviting social <a href=#>media influencers on a trip</a> to the company’s warehouses. The decision comes amid reports that Shein is attempting to rebrand their image because they are planning for an <a href=# rel=noopener>Initial Public Offering</a> (IPO), which would allow the company to offer its shares to the public and raise equity capital. Two dozen <a href=# rel=noopener>lawmakers put a pause</a> on that mission, calling on the Securities and Exchange Commission to audit the company and verify that it does not use forced labor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>A Top Shein Exec on That Influencer Trip Fiasco</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As a global company, SHEIN takes visibility across our entire supply chain seriously. We are committed to respecting human rights and adhering to local laws and regulations in each market we operate in,” a company spokesperson <a href=# rel=noopener>told Reuters</a> in May.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What work did Shein allegedly steal?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Graphic designers Krista Perry, Larissa Martinez and Jay Baron are the plaintiffs in the suit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perry, a Massachusetts-based designer, says that Shein sold a “Make it Fun” graphic she created online. When she contacted Shein about the stolen poster design, the company offered to pay her $500. Perry did not accept. The following year, the complaint alleges, Shein reached out to Perry to see if she wanted to contribute work for a capsule collection designed by aspiring artists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“How dare you contact me after my artwork has been stolen and the hard time I was put through with the people at Shein to resolve it,” Perry told the retailer, according to the filing. She also said that Shein stole a floral blanket design she has intellectual property rights for in 2020.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Baron, founder of Retrograde Supply Co., claims Shein stole an embroidered patch he created with the phrase “Hello, I’m Trying My Best.” Martinez, CEO of Los Angeles-based clothing company Miracle Eye, says that the retailer stole her orange daisy overalls design.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shein’s decision to take their designs has cost the designers serious damage. “As a result of Defendants’ misconduct as alleged herein,” the complaint alleges, the plaintiffs’ reputations and career “has been irreparably tarnished, diminishing the value of [their] works, and decreasing revenue derived from [their] work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlqfXSBjqyfnqGeYrmiw9KuoK1lk6S9ur7IoJ%2BtZZmjs7O1zaCcpp2eqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wednesday-showrunners-finale-season-2-jenna-ortega-1235443656.html><span>←</span><span>Wednesday Showrunners Break Down Finale Twists, TeaseTylers Return and Reveal Seaso</span></a>
