So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;close the apps on&nbsp;standby for some reason, it’s ok&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave them&nbsp;be.</p><p>Cached data consumes a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;precious space, and buying extra cloud space is&nbsp;not the only way to&nbsp;retrieve some. Whenever you see that you’re out of&nbsp;memory, and you’ve got literally nothing to&nbsp;delete, check all your messengers. Even if&nbsp;you deleted the photo from the camera roll, it’s still stored in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cache. Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;your messenger settings and delete all the cached files.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;sure sign your charger has gone bad. When you notice it&nbsp;takes more time to&nbsp;charge your phone, like earlier, you could go&nbsp;full-charged within an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half, and now it&nbsp;takes more than 3&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, you have to&nbsp;replace the charger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cbd/d76/6a8ee950d488faeb340fa120f8.png><p>If&nbsp;you see your phone cable has turned green, throw it&nbsp;away and replace it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;new one. The wire inside the cable is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;copper, and this metal turns green when it&nbsp;corrodes&nbsp;— just like some statues out there are made of&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;the wire has rusted, the charger is&nbsp;not safe to&nbsp;use anymore because it&nbsp;loses its conductive properties and may even cause an&nbsp;electrical fire. So&nbsp;whenever you see a&nbsp;greenish tint on&nbsp;your usually white cable, toss it&nbsp;without hesitation.</p><p>This one doesn’t happen that often, but if&nbsp;you live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;moist or&nbsp;dusty environment, one day, you can see rust on&nbsp;the connecting ends. Rust often can’t be&nbsp;cleaned, and even if&nbsp;you manage to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;might break the delicate pins on&nbsp;the charging cable. So, it’s probably best to&nbsp;replace your charger right away.</p><p>Charging ports get loose over time, and once it&nbsp;happens, you start to&nbsp;hold your phone at&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular angle to&nbsp;charge&nbsp;it. Take action as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you notice it&nbsp;— either ask a&nbsp;specialist to&nbsp;fix it&nbsp;or&nbsp;replace the charger. If&nbsp;your phone doesn’t charge, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not necessarily the charger’s fault&nbsp;— the problem can be&nbsp;about the adapter. The USB ports in&nbsp;adapters can get loose over time, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re sure the cable is&nbsp;fine, check the adapter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37b/721/6d3ffc51c2a723d1f71a260437.png><p>Also, sometimes the problem may be&nbsp;about the battery. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;so&nbsp;that the adapters seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fine, same with the cables, but the phone just won’t charge. Check the cable jack: sometimes it&nbsp;catches a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;lint, which results in&nbsp;charging problems. You can easily clean it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;toothpick. Don’t use a&nbsp;needle or&nbsp;any other metal object, though, as&nbsp;you may damage the port.</p><p>Your phone may malfunction not only because of&nbsp;battery problems. Unnecessary data can make it&nbsp;work slower, so&nbsp;reboot your phone once a&nbsp;week. Don’t overload your device. Too many pics or&nbsp;documents don’t make it&nbsp;work any faster either. If&nbsp;you store all the important information in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud, you’ll also have access there from any device.</p><p>A&nbsp;simple explanation of&nbsp;why&nbsp;1% might last a&nbsp;long time is&nbsp;that the phone has underestimated the current battery capacity. Then, when it&nbsp;gets down to&nbsp;what it&nbsp;thinks should be&nbsp;almost empty, displaying&nbsp;1%, it&nbsp;finds that the battery has more capacity left than it&nbsp;estimated. There’s also a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;<a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a>: when you see that your phone’s about to&nbsp;turn off, it&nbsp;kinda encourages you to&nbsp;plug it&nbsp;in&nbsp;ASAP. By&nbsp;the way, modem batteries can’t be&nbsp;fully charged or&nbsp;drained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ab6/84b/1a34305fe79e76539ff2be56e6.png><p>The last&nbsp;20% of&nbsp;a&nbsp;battery takes longer to&nbsp;charge than the rest because Lithium-ion batteries have a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;complex charging profile. When the battery is&nbsp;low, the charger supplies a&nbsp;fixed current&nbsp;— generally, the peak current that the charger/battery combination can handle. As&nbsp;the voltage increases, the charger switches over to&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant voltage profile, where the voltage is&nbsp;supplied at&nbsp;4.3V&nbsp;or so, and the current is&nbsp;entirely based on&nbsp;what the battery will take.</p><p>Sleeping with your phone under your pillow is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;very healthy idea. Cell phones, tablets, and other forms of&nbsp;hand-held technology release electromagnetic waves caused by&nbsp;X-rays, just as&nbsp;microwaves&nbsp;do, which may lead to&nbsp;serious health issues. Even though an&nbsp;adult person’s skull is&nbsp;quite thick (ha- like mine) and protects the brain well, it’s best to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the safe side and put your phone on&nbsp;the bedside table.</p><p>If&nbsp;you accidentally cracked the screen carrying your phone, replace it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;new one as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible. Yeah, it&nbsp;might not seem a&nbsp;problem since the touchscreen still works, but all the grease and dust will get through the cracks. It&nbsp;can eventually damage the screen, so&nbsp;hurry&nbsp;up!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/613/b79/cf9c1b581fae5cbf03d4591649.png><p>Facial skin is&nbsp;sensitive, and your phone is&nbsp;almost seven times dirtier than a&nbsp;toilet seat. Talking on&nbsp;the phone seems like rubbing a&nbsp;toilet seat against your cheek, ugh! So&nbsp;don’t press the phone against your face. You don’t want germs, do&nbsp;you? And...maybe wash your hands more often.</p><p>Blue light, brightness, and even font size can be&nbsp;the reason why you get a&nbsp;poor night’s sleep, especially if&nbsp;you love to&nbsp;scroll the feed until you fall asleep. Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;settings and turn on&nbsp;the blue light filter. It’s called “Night Shift” for iPhones, and there are blue light filter apps for Androids too. Also, adjust the brightness and font size.</p><p>Be&nbsp;careful using your phone on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=beach data-link=tag>beach</a>! Don’t leave it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the sun on&nbsp;your beach towel&nbsp;— though it&nbsp;doesn’t need sunscreen and there’s no&nbsp;way it&nbsp;can have sunburn, it&nbsp;can still be&nbsp;badly damaged by&nbsp;scorching rays. Lithium batteries are like humans: their operating temperature range is&nbsp;59&nbsp;°F—95 °F.&nbsp;Don’t charge your smartphone if&nbsp;it’s over 95&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;F because it&nbsp;may cause damage to&nbsp;the battery.</p><p>Also, it’s bad to&nbsp;charge it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cover&nbsp;— we&nbsp;know cell phones don’t enjoy the heat. The heat gets trapped inside, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can damage your battery. And never try to&nbsp;cool it&nbsp;off in&nbsp;a&nbsp;freezer, as&nbsp;lithium batteries can’t stand cold either. Boy, they’re picky!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f22/bb4/46585a5d3caa8366a0b244e9d4.png><p>Still, remember that some heat while charging your phone is&nbsp;completely fine. The charger uses a&nbsp;transformer to&nbsp;convert the&nbsp;AC line voltage from a&nbsp;wall outlet to&nbsp;the&nbsp;DC voltage required to&nbsp;charge the battery. No&nbsp;process would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hundred percent efficient, so&nbsp;some amount of&nbsp;electricity is&nbsp;released as&nbsp;heat. Excessive heat and especially discoloration are bad signs that the charger’s circuitry is&nbsp;beginning to&nbsp;fail. This may possibly result in&nbsp;an&nbsp;electric shock when you unplug the device. (bzzt, Ow!)</p><p>Pockets are one of&nbsp;the worst places to&nbsp;keep your phone. You can lose&nbsp;it, accidentally sit on&nbsp;it&nbsp;and crack the screen, or, what’s way worse, get radiated. A&nbsp;phone has a&nbsp;full range of&nbsp;signals that are not good for our health: mobile data, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC were added to&nbsp;the list. By&nbsp;the way, don’t use public Wi-Fi if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;leak your personal data.</p><p>Some people like to&nbsp;jailbreak their phones to&nbsp;access more app stores, not only the official ones. Well, before doing&nbsp;it, remember that this procedure literally eliminates the safeguard the manufacturer installed in&nbsp;your phone. Plus, unofficial app stores and apps can lead to&nbsp;data leaking. (If&nbsp;leaking occurs, your phone may need some absorbent undergarments. Ah, just kidding.)</p><p>One thing you may probably never leave home without is&nbsp;a&nbsp;power bank. They are much safer than any public hub. Make sure the amperage is&nbsp;correct&nbsp;— most modern smartphones charge at&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;A, and most power banks have a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;— 2.4&nbsp;A, which is&nbsp;totally&nbsp;ok. Check if&nbsp;the phone’s not too hot while charging&nbsp;— the hotter the battery, the less effective the charging.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorKtlk52us7PEq2ScmZKhsm7A1KulnpxdnL%2Bmsc1mq6iro2K2tXnArJipZWhmgXKAlmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sports-how-serena-williams-responds-to-accusations-that-she-was-born-a-guy.html><span>←</span><span>How Serena Williams responds to accusations that she 'was born a guy'</span></a>
