"Why wait until 50 and tell me how to do it?" he asked. "Share in your 20s, while you're doing it, rather than sharing it later."</p><p>When it comes to setting yourself up financially, "It's all about access to info and sharing it," he said.</p><p>It's the whole objective of "Life 101." By sharing what he's learned, Copeland wants to make students more comfortable and knowledgeable talking about money; having open conversations helps those involved build their own financial situation.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In his second class, Copeland discusses with students why people are afraid to talk about finances. He encourages them to talk to mentors and parents about money one homework assignment involves discussing retirement plans. He's trying to alleviate the level of discomfort that often characterizes conversations like these, he said.</p><p>In an upcoming class, Copeland is bringing high school kids in from Philadelphia. He plans to split his students into different groups and have them spend 15 to 30 minutes interactively teaching financial literacy to the high schoolers. He wants them to put into practice what they've learned and break it down at a high school level as a way to measure what they've retained over the course of the semester, he said.</p><p>Understanding and implementing personal financial management practices is related to better financial decisions and outcomes, she said.</p><p>"The goal of the class is [that] I want to make students able to teach this info to someone else," he said. "It's about sharing the info not what you do with your own stuff, but how you bring other people up with you."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=b6ca1d05-835d-3d81-a2d9-c928d1ae6931>An NFL player who teaches a UPenn class called 'Life 101' says saving money isn't about how much you make it's about how much you spend</span></strong></p><p><strong>DON'T MISS: <span id=9a03d9f5-227b-3977-ae75-6fa80bbf99f2>An NFL player who saves almost all his salary teaches a UPenn class called 'Life 101,' and his first assignment shocks students</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8CnZKeenGK9ra3Ynqlmr5ikerSt1Z6qZpmcory0wIyao6VlmJ7Abr%2FApZirsV2Wu6V5056YnKCVqHqiedSpnKemXZi5or%2FSZpqapJyasW64yJ%2BcaK6qmoR2wMs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-our-18-favorite-cartoon-characters-would-look-like-when-they-grew-up-636310.html><span>←</span><span>What Our18 Favorite Cartoon Characters Would Look Like When They Grew Up</span></a>
