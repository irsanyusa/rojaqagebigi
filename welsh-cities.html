It is tucked away in a dip in the hills, but it is nothing short of spectacular. Up in the main part of the city, there are lots of little shops, pubs and places to eat. The beaches nearby, such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Whitesands&nbsp;Beach</a>, are immaculate.</p><p>Due to its coastal location (it falls within the <a href=#>Pembrokeshire Coast National Park</a>), St&nbsp;Davids&nbsp;is used as the start and end point for wildlife-spotting boat trips. From there, you can visit <a href=#>Ramsey Island</a>, <a href=#>Skomer Island </a>and many more, with potential sightings of puffins, whales, dolphins and porpoises on the cards. <a href=#>Coasteering</a> was invented in St&nbsp;Davids, so it's a good place to do some scrambling and sea-jumping with a guide.</p><p><a href=#>More on St Davids on visitwales.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifKKuzq6raK%2BVocCpecKiq6Kdow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mangeons-24-une-scic-pour-lalimentation-locale-en-perigord-24.html><span>←</span><span>une Scic pour l'alimentation locale en Prigord (24)</span></a>
