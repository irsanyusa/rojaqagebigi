Practice:</strong> You know what they say about practice making you perfect, it takes a lot of work to be skilled at cheating.</p><p><strong>2. Set up different email addresses:</strong> Open a private email strictly dedicated to the 'other woman', one your girlfriend doesn't know about and always remember to logout, never save the password too.</p><p><strong>3. Register in a gym:</strong> Perfect way to cook up an excuse to sneak out and hang out with your side-chick. Every girl wants to see their man trim and slim, so you won't be queried.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp; Never leave history behind: </strong>It doesn't mean you should clear everything, that'll make her more suspicious. Just get rid of the most suspicious ones, you can always cook up a story about the rest.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>5. No affairs at work:</strong> This is a no-no, because it always backfires. Things go bad then she's bound to rat you out to your girlfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7xaipZqWVo3qwusuyZKGnp2LBsHnCoZyarF2ku27Fzq6pZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lp57BqbvUrWSgnaSptq%2BzjJyYrp%2BYqXyysc1tbrNu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-ralph-fiennes-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Ralph Fiennes Make?
