I didnt change my antidepressants because I wanted to lose weight, Id just accepted it and it was fine, she says. I got inspired to actually find a medication that helped me as a person and did all the things I wanted it to do.</p><p>When she found a combination that worked for her, Ariel says it felt like it turned back on my metabolism. She admits the weight loss she experienced wasnt something she even worked for, saying it came with medications and happened really quickly.</p><p>Yet, it made an undeniable difference in Ariels outlook. When I changed meds, and started feeling better about myself mentally, losing weight was helpful because it made me feel like I wasnt just stuck. I hate being stuck anywhere in life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The upside wasnt even necessarily her slimmer new frameIve always had curves and I like having curves, she saysbut her ability to finally see more visible results in the gym. Seeing her body changed helped her unearth her workout motivation again, and now she works out three times a week.</p><p>Her sweat sessions consist primarily of <a href=# id=094e15a1-a756-36ef-a1a0-c9593ba80435>strength training</a> . Ill do cardio occasionally but Im not looking to lose any more weight, Im looking to gain muscle, she says. I dont weigh myself, I don't care about that.</p><p>Ariels not a dieter, eitherin fact, she loves pizza, carbs, and a good cheese platebut shes trying to make a concerted effort to eat healthier. I know eating a ton of cheese, bread, greasy food isnt great for my heart or my insides so Im working on that, she says. These days shes focused on making small changes (think: turkey burgers instead of ground beef) and upping her meal prep game. Im trying to make more foods that will last me throughout the week, she says.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Ariels recent weight fluctuations have made her the target of plenty of cruelty on social media. I think the one thing that bugs me the most is when people say Oh thank god she lost weight, she used to be so fat, she says.</p><p>While she used to <a href=# id=fcb6a9ae-93ca-3456-ac71-bc282e4e6058>fire back in the comments</a> of her Instagram posts, she changed gears after a fan pointed out that she spent more time responding to negative comments than nice ones. Its hard not to because Im a feisty person, nobody likes being treated that way, she says.</p><p>But shes committed to focusing on only what makes her happyand that includes continuing to crush her workouts in the gym. Im doing something for myself that Im seeing positive results from, and that makes me feel stronger and better, she says. Im feeling more energized and healthier, and its inspiring me to do new things.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOmqminZxixKq6056pZqeeYsSmtcahq2akn6jAbr%2FWoqucoJmjtG6tza2gnZ2gp7K0v8Cnq6xlkaOxbrPErauippdiurDAyK%2BYrZ2UYravedOhnGippKmGrsOU</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cockroaches-japan-zoo-exhibition.html><span>←</span><span>A Japanese Zoo Is Trying To Get You To Like Cockroaches</span></a>
