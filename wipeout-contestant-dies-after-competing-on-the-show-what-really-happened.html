One contestant Michael Paredes suffered a medical emergency while completing the obstacles on November 18. He died a day later and the cause of death has finally been revealed.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws9X95YrgG4</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wipeout-contestant-michael-paredes-died-after-collapsing-on-the-course>‘Wipeout’ Contestant Michael Paredes Died After Collapsing On The Course</h2><p>The 38-year-old completed two obstacles but struggled when he got to the third and fell into the water. He had difficulties trying to swim and get his body out of the water. He was pulled out of the pool by staff members nearby. They put him in a wheelchair where he suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Bystanders performed CPR and Paredes was resuscitated and taken to the hospital. He died the next day.</p><p>The L.A. County coroner’s office stated that Paredes suffered a blockage in his coronary arteries, along with an acute case of pneumonia. He died from a heart attack and had an undetected coronary artery disease. There were no drugs or alcohol found in his body at the time of his death. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to TMZ,</a> Paredes had no prior reported medical history and may not have even known about this disease.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ CONTESTANT NIKKI MCKIBBIN TRAGICALLY PASSED AWAY —&nbsp;A LOOK AT HER LEGACY</a></strong></p><p>Paredes frequently took Nutrex Outlift Amped, a pre-workout dietary supplement. The morning of his Wipeout appearance, Paredes reportedly drank a cup of water mixed with the supplement powder. However, the autopsy report does not indicate that this played a factor in his death.</p><p>His fiancé also was a participant on Wipeout. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She told NBC News</a> that he exercised two hours a day, five days a week. They both took drug tests, an EKG and a COVID-19 test before filming the show and passed all of them. The couple sold wellness products along with the Nutrex supplement that Paredes took before his death.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-the-safety-protocols-on-set-of-the-show>What Are The Safety Protocols On Set Of The Show?</h3><p>The Wipeout reboot is hosted by&nbsp;John&nbsp;Cena,&nbsp;Camille Kostek&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nicole Byer. All contestants must undergo medical exams before they are cleared to participate on the show. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to E! News,</a> there are several medics on set along with a safety producer on hand at all times during filming. All safeguards were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly followed on set</a> on the day Paredes suffered his medical emergency.</p><p>The network later offered their condolences after news of Paredes’ death. “We are devastated to have learned of his passing and our deepest sympathy goes out to the family,” a TBS spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>The new season of Wipeout has yet to air but the show is notoriously known for its dangerous obstacles that lead to some very scary falls. Over a decade ago, another contestant, Tom Sparks, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">died after competing on the show</a> after complaining of knee pain on the obstacle course. It was revealed that he suffered a stroke.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/2pHq_UEM0p/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GORDON RAMSAY CURSE —&nbsp;CONTESTANTS THAT HAVE TRAGICALLY DIED SINCE WORKING WITH HIM</a></strong></p><p>“We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family and our thoughts are with them at this time,” Producers Endemol Shine North America said after news of Paredes’ death rocked the Wipeout community.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Simon-Cowell-The-X-Factor-Israel-Britains-Got-Talent-Americas-Got-Talent-2.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell Is FINALLY Returning To TV In The Most Unexpected Way Possible" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qKnnqelqXqku82tnKyskaPBbrDInqpmmZapsrN5wqikqZ2knruoec6nZK2glWLAqbvWZq6hmaRiv6aty6WwZqCRpb2musSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-idol-announces-february-premiere-date-for-season-22.html><span>←</span><span>'American Idol' Announces February Premiere Date for Season 22</span></a>
