While the grammar in this statement is technically correct, it’s not a totally natural way to express this idea.

<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Is it okay to use according to me in a sentence?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What do you think about the following statement?</p><p>“According to me, salmon sashimi is the most delicious food in the world.”</p><p>Does it sound okay to you, or is there something a bit awkward about it?&nbsp;</p><p>While the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar</a> in this statement is technically correct, it’s not a totally natural way to express this idea. In English, it’s unusual to use “according to me” when you’re stating your own thoughts or opinions.&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering why? You’re not alone! This is a common question among <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English learners</a>. Below, we’ll discuss why “according to me” isn’t commonly used, what to say instead, and when it is okay to use it!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Why-you-shouldn’t-say-“according-to-me”>Why you shouldn’t say “according to me”</h2><p>As we mentioned above, using “according to me” isn’t completely wrong in a grammatical sense. However, it’s just not natural to use <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the pronoun “m</a><a href=#>e”</a> in most “according to” statements.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s why …&nbsp;</p><p>Another way of saying “according to” is “as stated by.” You use it to identify who made a particular statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example: You might say to a friend, “According to my environmental science professor, climate change is an irreversible problem.” In this example, the professor has made a statement, and you’re relaying that information to your friend. It makes sense to use “according to” in this case—you’re giving your friend some information and telling them who said it.</p><p>But saying “according to me” is a bit strange. It sounds like you’ve had a conversation with yourself, you told yourself something, and now you’re reporting to someone else what you told yourself in that conversation. A little weird, right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-to-say-instead-of-“according-to”>What to say instead of “according to”</h2><p>Most of the time, when people use “according to me,” what they’re trying to do is give their opinion. If that sounds like you, we’ve got some alternatives for you to use.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>In my opinion/in my view</h3><p>When you want to share your thoughts about something, you can express it using “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in my opinion</a>.”</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “In my opinion, Titanic is the worst movie ever made.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>As far as I’m concerned</h3><p>This is a variation of “in my opinion” and “in my view,” so you can use it exactly the same way.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I understand what you’re saying, but <a href=#>as far as I’m concerned</a>, spring is the most beautiful season.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I think</h3><p>This expression is just as useful as the above-mentioned ones, though a bit more casual.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Technology is useful and convenient, but I think people need to learn how to do some things the old-fashioned way.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-“according-to-me”-is-okay>When “according to me” is okay</h2><p>Despite what we’ve said above, you can use “according to me” in a couple of scenarios (both of which are a little bit <a href=#>cheeky</a>). Here are some “according to me” examples!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To defend a statement&nbsp;</h3><p>If you’ve made a statement and someone questions you about it, feel free to use “according to me.”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p><strong>You: </strong>“This is the best pizza in town.”</p><p><strong>Your friend:</strong> “Oh yeah? According to whomwho??”</p><p><strong>You: </strong>“According to me!”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p><strong>Friend: </strong>“According to my mom, you should wait 30 minutes after eating before going swimming.”</p><p><strong>You: </strong>“Well, according to me, that rule is nonsense!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Share your opinions with the right expressions</h2><p>Hopefully, we’ve helped you understand why “according to me” isn’t usually the correct choice. Make sure you use expressions like “in my opinion” and “I think” whether you’re speaking to a friend, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing an essay</a> or taking an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">oral exam</a>. You’ll ensure all of your thoughts and opinions are coming across clearly and accurately.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
