However, there is one notable absence that has left many supporters scratching their heads. Longtime DWTS pro Sasha Farber will not be joining the tour this time around, and fans can’t quite believe it.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sasha-farber-will-not-be-on-the-dwts-live-tour-2024>Sasha Farber Will Not be on the DWTS Live Tour 2024</h2><p>The official lineup for the tour was unveiled on October 17, 2023. The touring cast members include Alan Bersten, Britt Stewart, Brandon Armstrong, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniella Karagach</a>, Pasha Pashkov, Rylee Arnold, and Gleb Savchenko. Emma Slater is set to serve as the host, and Julianne Hough will make special appearances on select dates.</p><p>One name that was surprisingly missing from the roster was Farber. This comes as a surprise to many, as Farber has been a consistent presence on the tour since 2017. He initially joined the traveling show in 2015 and took a brief hiatus before returning. While fans were eager to see him back in action, the absence of his name has certainly shocked fans.</p><p>Fans were quick to express their reactions and concerns on various platforms. A Reddit thread dedicated to discussing the tour lineup drew comments from disappointed supporters. Some were taken aback by the absence of Farber, while others speculated on the reasons behind this decision.</p><p>“Looking forward to this tour. Shocked that Farber, Alexis, Katya, or even Ezra won’t be joining, but I think it’ll be another great show,” one fan wrote.</p><p>Amid this absence, Farber is actively participating in Season 32 of DWTS, partnering with American Pie actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyson Hannigan</a>. While the two seem to enjoy their time on the show, their scores have placed them in the middle of the pack throughout the season. Despite the challenges, Farber expressed his admiration for his partner, praising her in an Instagram post.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-speculate-reason-behind-sasha-farber-s-absence>Fans Speculate Reason Behind Sasha Farber’s Absence</h2><p>As the news of Farber’s absence from the 2024 DWTS tour lineup continues to sink in, fans are left speculating about the possible reason he left the tour behind. While no official statement has been made, Reddit threads have been buzzing with theories and observations.</p><p>Some fans speculated that Farber might have chosen to take a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">break</a> from the tour for personal reasons. Others suggested that the inclusion of new pros like Pashkov and Karagach might have affected the budget and led to Farber’s omission. Additionally, the limited number of cities on Julianne Hough’s tour schedule was seen as a possible factor. Given the assumption that Hough’s involvement might come at a premium.</p><p>While the exact reasons for Farber’s absence remain a mystery, fans continue to support him, express their disappointment, and offer various theories as they eagerly await further updates on his future with DWTS.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_RyleeArnold_HarryJowsey_Disney_Christopher-Willard-220x147.jpg alt="Harry Jowsey, Rylee Arnold Mourn Death of His Puppy Ahead of ‘DWTS’ Monster Night" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWWlru0ecCrnGarmKSwrLHDZquhmaRiwKK%2Fx5pkn5mil7Kzedaopa1lkpp6sa3RrWSonl2ptaq%2FjLKcmqqjYrmqwsRmq6itomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-mystery-thriller-books.html><span>←</span><span>When No One Is Watching: The 100 Best Mystery and Thriller Books</span></a>
