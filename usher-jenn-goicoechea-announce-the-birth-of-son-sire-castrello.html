In a newborn photo, we get a glimpse of the baby’s nose and lips as well as its tiny hospital gown. There’s no way to know when this photo was exactly taken, but I think we can all agree he already looks like his father.</strong></p><p>“Hi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond … I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar … A.K.A Ra Ra,” Usher wrote in his <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram post</a>.</p><p>Usher now has two children with girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea. Together they share Sire Castrello Raymond and Sovereign Raymond (who recently turned one year old). Usher also shares two sons Usher V (13) and Navid (12) with ex-wife Tameka Foster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-usher-expands-family-with-two-babies-in-a-year>Usher Expands Family with Two Babies in a Year</h2><p>Usher’s announcement took many fans by surprise. Many commented on how quietly this new baby was born while others compared Usher to <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a>.</p><p>Considering this is only Usher’s fourth child with a second long-time partner, the comparisons seem rushed. He has not done anything to draw this kind of attention quite yet.</p><p>Rumors sparked about Usher and Goicoechea when they were seen kissing backstage at the Hollywood Bowl in 2019. About a year later they were seen at the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscars Party acting very close. Some sources think that the two confirmed their relationship when taking a <a href=#>bike ride together</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>As for their most recent pregnancy, fans first found out that Usher and his girlfriend were expecting again at the <a href=#>2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards</a>. At these awards last May, Goicoechea was seen rocking a baby bump on the red carpet. Soon after this appearance, Usher began his Las Vegas residency at Caesar’s Place. In July he <a href=#>opened up</a> about this new chapter of life him and Goicoechea are currently in. He also shared that he enjoys being a girl-dad.</p><p>Congratulations to both Usher and Jenn Goicoechea on their newest edition!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NUP_194863_00968.jpg alt="Why Do the Coaches Win ‘The Voice’ and Not the Singers?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571Kyfnqpdn7KvuoygpqKbn5qwqbHAZpinpp%2Bqu6SxjK2fnmWSnr%2B1tIyonWarn6N6tLXRnmScmaOpv6a4y6hm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigel-dempster.html><span>←</span><span>Nigel Dempster popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
