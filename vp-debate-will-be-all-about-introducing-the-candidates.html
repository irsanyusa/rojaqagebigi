More than four out of 10 voters (41 percent) said they have never heard of or have no opinion of Kaine, and 33 percent said the same of Pence.</p><p>Among the national electorate, Pence is slightly more popular than Kaine, with 35 percent holding a favorable opinion of the Indiana Republican and 32 percent saying he is unfavorable.</p><p>Nationally, voters are split on Kaine, with 30 percent viewing him favorably and an equal percentage viewing him unfavorably.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vponeagain.png alt=vponeagain width=900 height=528 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But in their respective states, Pence’s approval rating has taken a hit since he became Donald Trump’s running mate, while Kaine’s has not since he joined Hillary Clinton’s ticket, according to Morning Consult’s <a href=#>Senate</a> and <a href=#>Governor</a> Approval Rankings.</p><p>Pence’s approval rating in Indiana has declined from 48 percent in the first quarter of the year to 45 percent in September.
