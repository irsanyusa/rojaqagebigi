Or, is&nbsp;it&nbsp;even possible to&nbsp;befriend robots? Ask Will Robinson. Meanwhile, I’m here to&nbsp;answer all your questions surrounding what our <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with them will look like in&nbsp;the future!</p><p>Let’s take it&nbsp;all the way back, from the importance that having friends plays in&nbsp;our lives and why as&nbsp;human beings we&nbsp;definitely need <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>. As&nbsp;of&nbsp;today, it’s been proven again and again that romantic relationships improve our <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> and even help&nbsp;us live longer. And despite the fact that historically they’ve been treated as&nbsp;less valuable than romantic and family relationships, now we&nbsp;know the same goes for friendships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ae4/2a6/f6ebc15f07b68f044a45df3029.png><p>Part of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;actually due to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>overlaps between mental and physical health</a>. That&nbsp;is, if&nbsp;you’re being socially active, it’s most likely you’re being physically active as&nbsp;well. But it&nbsp;also has a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a>.</p><p>For instance, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>several studies</a> that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to&nbsp;study patterns of&nbsp;brain activity show that interaction with friends leads to&nbsp;heightened activity in&nbsp;the striatum, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;region involved in&nbsp;reward. And in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one study</a>, researchers found that when participants were given the opportunity to&nbsp;share money with a&nbsp;friend, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;disliked, neutral or&nbsp;unfamiliar person, reward regions were most active when they chose their friend.</p><p>So, it’s no&nbsp;wonder individuals with a&nbsp;strong sense of&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;their friends tend to&nbsp;have longer and healthier lives! It&nbsp;is&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they are always being rewarded! But to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more specific about what <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>health benefits</a> valuable friendships provide, first of&nbsp;all, they put you at&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower risk for hypertension. In&nbsp;addition, they help you sleep better as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;heal faster!</p><p>And the more friends you have, the better! Having a&nbsp;wider variety of&nbsp;social relationships may even enhance your ability to&nbsp;ward off a&nbsp;cold! However, when you have to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spend time alone</a> and not by&nbsp;choice, your white blood cells change their behavior, which leads to&nbsp;more <a href=# title=inflammation data-link=tag>inflammation</a> and a&nbsp;weakened immune response...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/580/bf1/c9e6d153cbb9776a64466d0292.png><p>On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;all this, friends not only help your physical health, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>your mental health</a> as&nbsp;well! According to&nbsp;one research, there’s a&nbsp;link between the time you spend with friends and whether the brain later processes rejection as&nbsp;threatening. Those who had spent more time with friends show less sensitivity to&nbsp;social exclusion. Now, where do&nbsp;robots enter the picture? Well, in&nbsp;the future, we&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;restricted to&nbsp;only being friends with living and breathing human beings or&nbsp;pets even.</p><p>To&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;explore the idea of&nbsp;human-robot friendship, we&nbsp;must understand the very basics of&nbsp;robotics. Most of&nbsp;you may be&nbsp;familiar with the concept of&nbsp;robots, but it’s actually important to&nbsp;define them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate entity from other types of&nbsp;machines.</p><p>You see, unlike other machines, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>robots interact with the world</a>. Based on&nbsp;their actions, they are able to&nbsp;adapt and make changes to&nbsp;their surroundings as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;the world around them. They can independently sense, reason, plan, and take action. As&nbsp;well as&nbsp;performing tasks autonomously, they can also extend human capabilities, and mimic human actions.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>field of&nbsp;robotics traditionally centers</a> on&nbsp;creating robots to&nbsp;perform simple or&nbsp;repetitive tasks, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;tasks with hazardous conditions for humans. Yet, thanks to&nbsp;the developments in&nbsp;machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;measurable increase in&nbsp;human-to-robot interactions. There are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>some reports</a> which suggest that the number of&nbsp;robots around the world could reach 20&nbsp;million by&nbsp;2030.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/09d/8a7/a70cf45d0c89c1593f35082c8c.png><p>And that can only mean we’ll be&nbsp;exposed to&nbsp;more and more robots in&nbsp;our everyday lives. Therefore, all of&nbsp;us will have to&nbsp;interact with them one way or&nbsp;another. Yet again, does all of&nbsp;this really mean we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;bond true friendships with them? And if&nbsp;so, will our robot friends improve our physical and <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> in&nbsp;every way like our human friends&nbsp;do? Or, are robots even capable of&nbsp;being friends?</p><p>As&nbsp;of&nbsp;today, there are quite a&nbsp;few robots that can perform intelligent tasks, such as&nbsp;adjusting how they respond to&nbsp;individuals, and organizing themselves without direct human input. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Some examples</a> of&nbsp;that include prosthetic arms that can learn from the person who is&nbsp;wearing them and adapt to&nbsp;their needs along the way.</p><p>Then there are physical therapy robots that coach patients to&nbsp;learn a&nbsp;task by&nbsp;assessing their individual needs and offering them just the right amount of&nbsp;help. There are also what researchers call “swarm” robots, aka a&nbsp;large group of&nbsp;robots. After getting a&nbsp;single command, they are able to&nbsp;collaborate with each other and organize on&nbsp;their own to&nbsp;fulfill the task at&nbsp;hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a37/325/87bd7b54dbad0b04de20067f84.png><p>This makes them perfect for dangerous tasks such as&nbsp;exploring a&nbsp;collapsed building. Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;human having to&nbsp;give commands to&nbsp;each individual robot, you send in&nbsp;the team, and they coordinate the whole mission themselves. Talk about autonomy and cognition! So, since robots are able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all that, it’s obvious they can make good friends, right...?</p><p>Well, friendship is&nbsp;not all about benefiting from each other. Take <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aristotle</a>, for example. He&nbsp;says that “true” friendship is&nbsp;premised on&nbsp;mutual goodwill, admiration, and shared values. Accordingly, friendship is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;partnership of&nbsp;equals. Can we&nbsp;achieve that with robots? Because so&nbsp;far, the relationship we&nbsp;have with robots is&nbsp;what Aristotle would call an&nbsp;inferior one...</p><p>Yet again, even in&nbsp;this state of&nbsp;benefiting from robots, we&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;a&nbsp;robot just like we&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;pets, possessions, and people. Many folks these days, always thank ChatGPT for helping them out with stuff! Some people who work on&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>robot ethics</a>” believe that what they&nbsp;do, that&nbsp;is, bonding with a&nbsp;robot, is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;emotional energy. That is&nbsp;because these entities can only simulate emotions, and this will always be&nbsp;less rewarding than forming human-to-human bonds.</p><p>Well, I&nbsp;already named my&nbsp;robot vacuum cleaner... Sorry, not sorry... And I&nbsp;know I’m not the only one. According to&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineer who worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;vacuum cleaner robot company, when customers were offered brand-new robots to&nbsp;replace their broken ones, they would decline the offer saying “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>No, I&nbsp;want&nbsp;MY robot!</a>” They didn’t want to&nbsp;replace the robot because they’d grown attached to&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/853/c4e/ad9cb15ac190a715a289ce6187.png><p>The thing&nbsp;is, according to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>psychological evidence</a> we&nbsp;have so&nbsp;far, what&nbsp;I and many other people do&nbsp;couldn’t be&nbsp;any more normal. Because, according to&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;human beings, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;our nature to&nbsp;extend emotional connections to&nbsp;things that are very different from&nbsp;us. That is&nbsp;even when we&nbsp;know they are manufactured and pre-programmed. But the question&nbsp;is, do&nbsp;those connections constitute a&nbsp;friendship comparable to&nbsp;that shared between humans?</p><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;try to&nbsp;answer this question based on&nbsp;Aristotle’s ideas on&nbsp;friendship, the answer would be&nbsp;“no.” Then again, when we&nbsp;take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;all types of&nbsp;human-to-human relationships, very few of&nbsp;those could be&nbsp;described as&nbsp;completely equal. And even then, the ones that can be&nbsp;considered equal are all destined to&nbsp;evolve over time. So, instead, let’s look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;this way; robots can be&nbsp;good companions which can address our urge to&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;social connection.</p><p>They can provide physical comfort, emotional support, and enjoyable social exchanges. They won’t reject or&nbsp;judge you. One might argue that they also won’t understand or&nbsp;empathize with you. But the thing&nbsp;is, they don’t really need&nbsp;to... Most people talk to&nbsp;their pets even though these animals don’t understand the words. But they still help you feel less lonely at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, and robots can do&nbsp;exactly that!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/41e/7f7/7b89575be488b54368ff77e164.png><p>There are potential risks with human-to-robot friendships, however... If&nbsp;robots can become our friends, they can very well become our enemies, too... But not in&nbsp;the way that sci-fi movies depict. Robot friends can turn into a&nbsp;problem if&nbsp;people start neglecting their relationships with other people to&nbsp;spend more time with a&nbsp;machine.</p><p>And that is&nbsp;actually already happening with video games and social media. Yet again, we&nbsp;can all agree that robots aren’t the ones to&nbsp;blame for&nbsp;it...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCiuoyaZKunkqTBbrHVnqlmmpWYvK6xjLKmrqpdm7%2Bqsc2dZHFpZmeCdns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./un-accord-cadre-pour-encourager-un-soutien-pluriannuel-et-multi-partenarial-des-centres-sociaux.html><span>←</span><span>Un accord-cadre pour encourager un soutien pluriannuel et multi-partenarial des centres sociaux</span></a>
