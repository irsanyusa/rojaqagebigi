Considering their popularity, it’s almost impossible for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;believe that their paths hadn’t crossed creatively before then, but it’s true. It&nbsp;seems that the universe recognized this blunder and put Farrell and Kidman not just in&nbsp;1&nbsp;but 2&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cad/0cf/669bfb5387b12891749e2bfd04.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, Kidman and Farrell shared the screen for 2&nbsp;major productions: Yorgos Lanthimos’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Killing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sacred Deer</i></a><i> </i>and Sofia Coppola’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Beguiled</i></a>. Both movies received accolades from the Cannes Film Festival and admiration from our hearts all thanks to&nbsp;Kidman and Farrell’s on-screen chemistry.</p><p><h2>They clicked instantly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/192/2cf/9baa0c59739e5d70ead3b11da7.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Interestingly, Kidman and Farrell’s collaboration didn’t remain strictly professional, as&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;connected incredibly well on&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal level too. What helped was the fact that Farrell made Kidman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feel</a> very comfortable around him. In&nbsp;particular, <i>The Killing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sacred Deer </i>included a&nbsp;few intimate scenes between her and Farrell, which is&nbsp;always nerve-wracking. However, the actress noted that she felt perfectly “safe” around her film partner.</p><p>Kidman mentioned that being intimate with your co-star on&nbsp;camera is&nbsp;always an&nbsp;awkward experience, so&nbsp;she was happy to&nbsp;get through it&nbsp;with someone who made things feel like a&nbsp;breeze.</p><p><h2>Kidman has grown to&nbsp;adore Farrell.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d93/fd2/f3341d5fc9a442e26f3da4afc5.jpg><p>Shootpix/ABACAPRESS.COM/EAST NEWS</p><p>After working on&nbsp;2&nbsp;movies together in&nbsp;the same year, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;attending promotional gatherings and film festivals for them, Kidman and Farrell became very close. In&nbsp;2023, Farrell was honored by&nbsp;<i>TIME</i> magazine, which included him on&nbsp;their Top 100 Most Influential People of&nbsp;2023, and they chose Kidman to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;dedication about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ae/07f/fbeb105eada86798b39160d287.jpg><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> off by&nbsp;calling Farrell both her “knight in&nbsp;shining armor” and “her partner in&nbsp;crime.” Kidman continued to&nbsp;say how much she admired his professionalism and how obvious it&nbsp;was that he’d had 30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;acting. She wrote that she was very grateful for his openness toward her and that she felt very “protective of&nbsp;him.” We&nbsp;can all only dream of&nbsp;our colleagues saying something so&nbsp;incredibly kind about&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>Other notable Hollywood male-female friendships</h2></p><p>While it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;while for Kidman and Farrell to&nbsp;work together, there are some Hollywood pairs who’ve been collaborating for decades and support each other through thick and thin. For example, <a href=#>Julia Roberts and George Clooney</a> first worked together on&nbsp;<i>Ocean’s Eleven </i>(2001) and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;over 5&nbsp;movies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>together</a>. While nothing ever happened to&nbsp;them romantically, they have become close friends and even refer to&nbsp;themselves as&nbsp;“goofy nuts.”</p><p>And when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;colleagues who did cross that romantic line and found their eventual way to&nbsp;friendship, we&nbsp;have <a href=#>Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez</a>. The 2&nbsp;briefly dated after working on&nbsp;the first <i>Fast &&nbsp;Furious </i>film together. Even though their intimate relationship didn’t last, the franchise did. And now, after over 2&nbsp;decades of&nbsp;working on&nbsp;these films, Diesel and Rodriguez are still as&nbsp;close as&nbsp;ever, platonically, of&nbsp;course.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ynoJynnJp6rLXDppinZaKarq212Z6bZpufobavecWaqaudnKF6uK3SZp%2Beql2gu6qzx61koqZdqLWqusinnmaZoqK8s3mXamxwbmdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./helen-parker.html><span>←</span><span>Helen Parker - Entertainment Executive</span></a>
