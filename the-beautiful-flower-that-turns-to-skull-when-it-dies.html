They come in many bright colours like red, pink, yellow, and white. Their petals are soft and can look like a dragon’s mouth, which is how they got their name.</p><p>But what makes snapdragons really interesting is what happens after they bloom and die. When snapdragons die, the flower dries up, and the seed pod that's left behind looks just like a tiny skull. This surprising change is why snapdragons are also called "dragon skulls."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Growing snapdragons</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Snapdragons are easy to grow and take care of if you’re considering planting one.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-10a29e9a-b59a-48bf-99dd-8b46410c4f3f data-caption="Snapdragons [harvesttotable]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/V1hktkpTURBXy9lYjc2ZWRiNjcwMTUyMzA4NTIwNmQwMzFkOWY5ZThiOC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>Here are some steps to grow them in your garden:</p><p><strong>1. Choose a sunny spot:</strong> Snapdragons need a lot of sunlight. Pick a place in your garden that gets at least six hours of sun every day.</p><p><strong>2. Prepare the soil:</strong> Snapdragons like soil that drains well. You can mix some sand into your soil to help with drainage.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3. Plant the seeds:</strong> Plant snapdragon seeds in early spring.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-df4945b0-8be6-4e75-92db-01de9e55a34b data-caption="Snapdragon seeds [thefreerangelife]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/5lWktkpTURBXy80MTRiMmZjMTJmOWMyNDEwODRjNjhjMDdhYjQ2YTE3Ny5qcGeSlQMAAM0EsM0DIJUCzQMWzQIPwsM></span><p>You can start them indoors and move them outside when it's warmer.</p><p><strong>4. Water regularly:</strong> Keep the soil moist but not too wet. Water the snapdragons regularly, especially when they are young.</p><p><strong>5. Fertilise occasionally: </strong>Use a balanced fertiliser to help your snapdragons grow strong and healthy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>The blooming season</h3></p><p>Snapdragons usually bloom from spring to early summer. Their bright flowers can last for a few weeks. During this time, they attract bees, butterflies, and other insects that help with pollination. This means snapdragons not only make your garden look pretty, but they also help the environment.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>The transformation</h3></p><p>After the blooming season, the flowers will start to die. This is when the magic happens. The petals fall off, and the seed pods begin to form. As the seed pods dry out, they shrink and twist. This process makes them look like tiny, spooky skulls.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c804336f-5dfc-44de-a683-5bbe70f699e3 data-caption="Snapdragon skulls [darkdwelling]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/YT9ktkpTURBXy8xM2U0ZWUxODE4NzU5NmZmYjhlNjc1OWFlNTYzYzZhZC5qcGeSlQMAAM0CgM0CgJUCzQKAzQKAwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This transformation is why snapdragons are so fascinating.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>Why do snapdragons turn into skulls?</h3></p><p>The skull-like shape of the seed pods is a natural part of the snapdragon’s life cycle. When the seed pods dry out, they split open to release seeds. The shape helps to protect the seeds until they are ready to spread and grow into new snapdragon plants. While it might look a bit creepy, it’s just nature’s way of ensuring the snapdragon can reproduce and continue its life cycle.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>Fun facts about snapdragons</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>1. Variety:</strong> There are many types of snapdragons,</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ec02083a-2ce1-48e7-ad5e-0c19f9141e03 data-caption="colours of snapdragon [wendy'sgarden]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/QPmktkpTURBXy85MTNjMjlhMmY3MTc5OTA4NjE0YjMwYjY2NmMzMWJjOC5qcGeRlQLNAwDNAcjCww></span><p>with flowers in almost every colour you can imagine.</p><p><strong>2.

Use natural remedies or insecticidal soap to keep them away.</p><p><strong>3.
