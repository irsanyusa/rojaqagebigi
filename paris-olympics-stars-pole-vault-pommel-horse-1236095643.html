French pole-vaulter Anthony Ammirati became an instant viral phenomenon for an incident in which it seemed as if his bulge —&nbsp;and only his bulge —&nbsp;failed to clear the bar. While he may be the only Olympian to have shot to fame for that particular issue in Paris, there have been several other online sensations created at the Olympics, including a super chill Turkish shooter and a muffin-loving swimmer.&nbsp;Here are Variety‘s top 5 most viral stars.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-primary-xl">Yusuf Dikec, aka Turkish John Wick</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Keanu Reeves’ deadly assassin was unwittingly dragged into the 2024 Olympics thanks to a Turkish shooter. Yusuf Dikec probably had little idea that he’d become a viral sensation when he stepped up to compete in the mixed team 10-metre air pistol event, but within hours of the competition on Tuesday, a photo of his casual attire and nonchalant one-hand-in-pocket demeanor was bouncing merrily around the world. Whereas most shooters don visors, chunky ear-defenders and special shooting lenses that shut out distractions, here was Dikec looking down the barrel of his gun with just a standard pair of glasses and solitary yellow ear plug (all while wearing what looked like a standard t-shirt). And he would go on to help him team win silver. Many memes would follow underlining such a badass approach, but the best was to come when he posted a picture of him snuggling up to his pet cat. As one X user noted: “If something ever happens to that cat we’re about to get 4 movies out of this guy.”</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/featured_postwar_streaming_SR.jpg alt="Tattered white flag flying with a streaming symbol" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="c-span lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase u-font-family-basic lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-u-font-size-12 u-font-size-13@tablet u-color-brand-vip-primary"><a href=# class="c-span__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">VIP+</a></span><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">The Postwar Streaming Market: A Special Report</a></h3><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Taylor-Swift-Elon-Musk.jpg alt="Elon Musk - Taylor Swift" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">Elon Musk's Offer to Father a Child With Taylor Swift Elicits Disgust: 'You're Creepy.

While Simone Biles may have been the star of the show, Team USA found an unlikely gymnastics hero in Stephen Nedoroscik, a Penn State alum with a degree in electrical engineering whose hobbies include timing himself solving Rubik’s Cubes. He also happens to specialize in one other apparatus — his sole reason for being in Paris and one he thankfully, absolutely nailed. As one X user put it, he “pommeled the hell out of a horse,” helping the men’s team to their first individual medal since 2016. Shots of Nedoroscik waiting for his (spectacular) turn with eyes closed and glasses on produced a barrage of memes, while his removal of spectacles to become the newly-crowned “Pommel Horse Guy” were soon compared to Clark Kent’s transformation from nerdy news reporter to Superman. Biopic writers are no-doubt already on the case.&nbsp;</p><h3>Popular on Variety</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/0D1ZqJjFa1</a></p>— Megan 📚 (@MegWritesBooks) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 29, 2024</a></figure><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-primary-xl">Kayak Cross, aka Mario Kart With Boats</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Every Olympics needs an event that, to the untrained eye, seems to be more about pure joyous chaos than expertly executed sporting prowess. In the Winter Olympics, it’s the snowboard cross, whereas in Paris the lunacy has shifted to water for the newly-introduced kayak cross. Four competitors are essentially dropped into the water from a 2-meter height and then must navigate themselves down a 210-meter whitewater course with hurdles including buoys they have to go around, an eskimo roll they must complete and —&nbsp;most importantly —&nbsp;each other’s kayaks. Despite the clear paddling skills of everyone involved, the races often appeared to turn into a watery version of bumper cars, or ‘Mario Kart With Boats’ as has been described on social media, with competitors regularly ramming into each other out. It’s absolute carnage (but wild to watch).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kayak Cross is kind of like Mario Kart with boats. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/5vE2PSrJxa</a></p>— ProfNoctis (@ProfNoctis) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 4, 2024</a></figure><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-primary-xl">Henrik Christiansen, aka Muffin Man</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Most Olympics athletes have been posting about their experiences in Paris on social media, but nobody could match Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen in making his online content so muffin-heavy. Christiansen’s TikTok account essentially transformed into a love letter to the chocolatey baked good available to athletes in the Olympic village. Among the 15 or so videos posted was one in which he declared himself to be the “Olympic Muffin Man.” It featured an audio clip from “Shrek” in which the Gingerbread Man asks “Do you know the Muffin Man?” Sadly Christiansen didn’t make it out of the heats for the men’s 1500m freestyle. Muffins weren’t blamed for the result.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my current olympics obsession is henrik christiansen, this swimmer from norway who’s obsessed with the chocolate muffins in the olympic village and can’t stop making tiktoks about them <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/v7MkOOj3o1</a></p>— aaalex 🪩🎀✨ (@dunebarbie) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 30, 2024</a></figure><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-primary-xl">Anthony Ammirati, aka Olympic Baguette</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In what may end up becoming the defining image of Paris 2024, French pole-vaulter Anthony Ammirati failed to clear 5.70m —&nbsp;and thus failed to qualify for the final —&nbsp;because of what appeared to be a large bulge in his tight pants, a large bulge which knocked the bar from its perch and sent thousands of internet comedians into immediate overdrive. “When you’re about to win an Olympic medal but your massive d*ck gets in the way while the whole world watches in slow motion,” “Oh, he brought that baguette to the game,” and “I see big things in his future,” were just some of the many, many posts on X. As was “Spend a decade training. Counting every calorie. Measuring every vital. Getting 8.15 hours of sleep every night. Only to lose out on an Olympic medal because your dong wasn’t tucked. Devastating.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anthony Ammirati failed the bar and the commentators are clearly having a
