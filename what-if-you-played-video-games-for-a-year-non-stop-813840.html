I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;admit I’m quite a&nbsp;gamer. So&nbsp;when&nbsp;I saw the ad&nbsp;in&nbsp;the paper, I&nbsp;called them immediately. Wanted: <strong>Video Game Player.</strong> It&nbsp;turned out the offer wasn’t that simple. Yes, my&nbsp;job was to&nbsp;play video games. But all day long.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day</strong>, <strong>7&nbsp;days a&nbsp;week</strong>, <strong>365 days</strong> in&nbsp;total.</p><p>I’d have 8&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;sleep and half an&nbsp;hour in&nbsp;the morning and in&nbsp;the evening to&nbsp;eat and shower. No&nbsp;days off, no&nbsp;vacation. Take it&nbsp;or&nbsp;leave&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;scared&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I was reluctant to&nbsp;agree. But then the employer told me&nbsp;my&nbsp;yearly salary, and&nbsp;I was&nbsp;in. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;did it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;year, I’d never have to&nbsp;work again. So, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5aa/ee2/b1d9aa5b2a8cc2e4a8a38543f7.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;1.</strong></p><p>They said I’d work and live in&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;office, and I’d have everything I&nbsp;need. At&nbsp;8:00 a.m., I&nbsp;arrived at&nbsp;the address. The place was huge and beautiful. A&nbsp;woman met me&nbsp;and took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;room, a&nbsp;dark room in&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the house. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;TV with a&nbsp;game station, speakers, and controllers. There was a&nbsp;comfortable couch, a&nbsp;table, and a&nbsp;bathroom.</p><p>It&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;gamer’s paradise.<strong> </strong>I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;stay there for a&nbsp;whole year, probably never even leave the room. According to&nbsp;the schedule, my&nbsp;day had to&nbsp;start at&nbsp;8&nbsp;a.m. I&nbsp;had half an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;take a<strong>&nbsp;shower</strong> and eat the <strong><a href=# title=breakfast data-link=tag>breakfast</a> </strong>delivered to&nbsp;my&nbsp;room. At&nbsp;<strong>8:30</strong>, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;start playing&nbsp;— well, <strong>working</strong>.</p><p>Every day, the system would generate a&nbsp;gaming selection according to&nbsp;my&nbsp;employer’s requirements and make me&nbsp;follow them. There were some snacks on&nbsp;the side table to&nbsp;eat if&nbsp;I got hungry, without interrupting my&nbsp;game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/752/6d5/689dc05b5baac68f7cf6b08f9d.png><p>I&nbsp;also got a&nbsp;10-minute break every 5&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bathroom and exercise. At&nbsp;11:30 p.m., the system shut down, and&nbsp;I got my&nbsp;dinner and shower time. Midnight till 8&nbsp;a.m. Sleep. Well, it&nbsp;seemed pretty easy and straightforward, and&nbsp;I was crazily excited. Exactly at&nbsp;8:30, my&nbsp;first game started. The first 8&nbsp;hours flew by&nbsp;in&nbsp;the blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye.</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;exercise a&nbsp;little, but&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;wait another two hours before my&nbsp;10-minute break. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, my&nbsp;neck started to&nbsp;hurt a&nbsp;little, but it&nbsp;didn’t matter. After getting some snacks, I&nbsp;kept playing for another two hours before&nbsp;I got my&nbsp;well-deserved break.&nbsp;10&nbsp;minutes was actually enough to&nbsp;fully recover and get back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;game for the remaining five hours.</p><p>To&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the best days of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. My&nbsp;dream had come true. I&nbsp;could play all day long, make a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money, and no&nbsp;one would bug&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c7a/09b/52330655f38ad760fad024fcac.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;2.</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;piercing siren woke me&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;clasp my&nbsp;hands over my&nbsp;ears while&nbsp;I looked for some kind of&nbsp;off switch, the noise was unbearable. Finally, I&nbsp;figured out that&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;get&nbsp;up, walk to&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV and press a&nbsp;button on&nbsp;it. To&nbsp;my&nbsp;relief, it&nbsp;worked. Okay, figured that one out. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;shower, and when&nbsp;I was done, breakfast was served.</p><p>By&nbsp;<strong>8:30&nbsp;</strong>I was ready and excited about my&nbsp;second day. And life had another surprise for&nbsp;me: when&nbsp;I saw the schedule for the day, I&nbsp;almost screamed. I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;playing a&nbsp;<strong>brand-new game</strong> that hadn’t even been released yet! It&nbsp;was just too exciting, I&nbsp;was sure&nbsp;I had the best job on&nbsp;the planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/016/806/0d2a6d53a38d89495c50ea4f34.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;4.</strong></p><p>Today was a&nbsp;little bit harder. I&nbsp;got blisters on&nbsp;my&nbsp;fingers, and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;bandage them. Playing 15&nbsp;hours straight was a&nbsp;little hard, and&nbsp;I needed an&nbsp;extra break.</p><p>I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;cheat and take a&nbsp;short pause after the first three hours, but it&nbsp;didn’t work. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I hit pause and put the controller down, the system went crazy. It&nbsp;didn’t turn off until&nbsp;I picked up&nbsp;the controller and started to&nbsp;play again. Okay, no&nbsp;pauses. Got&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ccd/131/098f80515d9638a794f94f3d7c.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;15.</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;had<strong> </strong>to&nbsp;bandage my&nbsp;hands as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;my&nbsp;fingers. Now I&nbsp;constantly have blurry eyes and can’t see straight anymore. And my&nbsp;legs feel like jelly. I&nbsp;keep reminding myself to&nbsp;move around as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible, but I’m always way too tired. What if&nbsp;I forget how to&nbsp;walk?</p><p>Yesterday I&nbsp;fell asleep right after work. I&nbsp;didn’t even eat. I&nbsp;just fell asleep. But my&nbsp;sleep hasn’t really been that restful recently. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams, I’m always racing, playing soccer, building houses out of&nbsp;cubes, fighting battles, and searching for objects. My&nbsp;job is&nbsp;haunting&nbsp;me, and it&nbsp;feels like&nbsp;I work <strong>24&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day</strong>, not 15.</p><p>Morning came. The siren woke me&nbsp;up, but the only thing&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was sleep. And what I’d do&nbsp;for a&nbsp;normal dream like a&nbsp;normal person... 350 days to&nbsp;go. Tonight, before bed, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<strong>plan</strong>, something to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;life as&nbsp;normal as&nbsp;possible, I&nbsp;can’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;like this anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/566/13b/39269a5e8eb7365cf62b07313c.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;32.</strong></p><p>One month down. My&nbsp;first small victory. I’m more organized, and&nbsp;I managed to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;nice system that keeps me&nbsp;from going crazy.<strong> </strong>I&nbsp;try to&nbsp;play standing up&nbsp;as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible and move around when I&nbsp;can. I&nbsp;spend all my&nbsp;breaks outside, enjoying the fresh air and doing vision exercises. I&nbsp;still have blurry and itchy eyes though...</p><p>And <strong>the bad news</strong>. Today I&nbsp;realized that... I’m seeing things, video game things. They’re creeping into my&nbsp;actual life. I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the shower last night, and&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;car crash right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;totally lost&nbsp;it, but it’s not real. It’s. Not. Real.</p><p>To&nbsp;make things worse, I’m starting to&nbsp;imagine that I’m actually a&nbsp;video game character. Strength: <strong>70</strong>. Intelligence: <strong>90</strong>. <a href=# title=Health data-link=tag>Health</a>: <strong>50</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/666/2a8/a7249f54fe8dd62f9d15867399.png><p><strong>Day 100.</strong></p><p>Being active was a&nbsp;good idea, but now&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;serious sleep disorder. I&nbsp;can’t sleep well, and&nbsp;I never get enough rest. I&nbsp;feel like I’m turning into&nbsp;a, well... I&nbsp;don’t even know anymore. I’m getting so&nbsp;tired, I&nbsp;don’t even have the energy to&nbsp;exercise. I&nbsp;haven’t been doing my&nbsp;workouts for a&nbsp;week now, and whenever I’m on&nbsp;the couch, I&nbsp;can’t feel my&nbsp;legs.</p><p>Well, at&nbsp;least&nbsp;I walk to&nbsp;the bathroom and back two times a&nbsp;day, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;legs aren’t totally shot. That’s something at&nbsp;least... I&nbsp;don’t remember not having all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body hurt. It&nbsp;hurts all the time, but somehow&nbsp;I got used to&nbsp;it. My&nbsp;wrists, my&nbsp;neck, my&nbsp;back. Everything hurts. I&nbsp;constantly have headaches. Health: <strong>30</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/df4/504/b9f6145339af152008aa9084bb.png><p><strong>Day 260.</strong></p><p>I’m having trouble getting to&nbsp;the bathroom these days. I&nbsp;can barely walk a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;steps, because my&nbsp;legs just don’t move. And I&nbsp;feel like&nbsp;I never leave the game, it’s my&nbsp;life now. Even if&nbsp;I’m on&nbsp;break, the games are all around&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;real life is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;crazy mix of&nbsp;all the games I’ve been playing.</p><p>Today, I&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;chest on&nbsp;the table. I’d never seen it&nbsp;before, so&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;see what was inside. I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;grab it&nbsp;for ages, then&nbsp;I realized it&nbsp;wasn’t real. It&nbsp;was just in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head. And I&nbsp;think I’ve doubled in&nbsp;size, because now&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;double the time on&nbsp;the couch that&nbsp;I used&nbsp;to. Health: <strong>20</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9e5/755/05714a54fcbda94349c893ff56.png><p><strong>Day 366.</strong></p><p>For the first time, no&nbsp;siren. The woman woke me&nbsp;up&nbsp;at&nbsp;11&nbsp;a.m., handed me&nbsp;my&nbsp;paycheck, and said&nbsp;I should&nbsp;go. The number on&nbsp;the paycheck was truly impressive, but&nbsp;I didn’t even have enough strength to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. I&nbsp;can’t believe it’s over. I&nbsp;did&nbsp;it.</p><p>Planes crash down right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me, but I’m so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;it&nbsp;that&nbsp;I don’t even pay attention. With my&nbsp;diamond sword in&nbsp;my&nbsp;hand, I&nbsp;waddle to&nbsp;the bathroom, crushing everything in&nbsp;my&nbsp;way because I’ve gotten way too big for this little room.</p><p>My&nbsp;pals are on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission to&nbsp;capture some castle, but that’s not my&nbsp;quest anymore. They’re not even real. Are they? To&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, I’m not even sure what’s real anymore. The woman takes me&nbsp;down the stairs to&nbsp;the front door. When I&nbsp;step outside, my&nbsp;eyes seal shut. The sunlight is&nbsp;so&nbsp;bright&nbsp;I can’t see a&nbsp;thing. The woman gives me&nbsp;a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;sunglasses, and I’m on&nbsp;my&nbsp;way.</p><p>I&nbsp;see people and other weird creatures running around, cars driving and cubed sheep grazing past&nbsp;me. It&nbsp;takes all my&nbsp;energy, but&nbsp;I get to&nbsp;a&nbsp;taxi and, finally, head home. So, now I’m rich and super unhealthy. I&nbsp;guess I’ll need the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life to&nbsp;recover from this marathon. And I’m never playing video games again.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lqaTCbrzLmrCenF2rtqWxzmaemqWVqHqnu9FmmGaxlZa%2FbrrOp2SsrJ%2Blenl9knFraWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./red-white-and-royal-blue-how-to-watch-online-free-streaming-1235693381.html><span>←</span><span>Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue: How to Watch the Queer Rom-Com Everyones Talking About Onlin</span></a>
