It’s frankly astonishing how much stuff you need for beach days, and you need a bag that can accommodate all that while still keeping out sand, water, and possibly some hungry seagulls. To help you figure out the best beach bag for your needs, we’ve rounded up a bunch of our favorites.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-beach-bags>Our top picks for the best beach bags</h2><h3>Best for All Day Cooling: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Corkcicle Estelle Tote</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/corkcicle.com/cdn/shop/products/90ET-W23-SN-1_1000x.png alt="Corkcicle Estelle Tote" title="Corkcicle Estelle Tote" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Corkcicle Estelle Tote</h3></p><p>Keeping your stuff cool at the beach is vital, whether it’s snacks for the kiddos or four six-packs of what is definitely, totally just soda, officer. That’s why our team put Corkcicle’s Estelle tote, a zippable insulated tote that offers a stylish alternative to typical rectangular or backpack-style cooler bags, to the test. The design features lightweight reinforced insulation, which in our experience of the bag, will keep a block-style ice pack mostly frozen for eight hours (even without ice, cold sodas we put in the bag were at least still chilled, if not fridge-cold, after eight hours, too). It has an optional shoulder strap, deep wrap-around pockets and exterior straps for holding towels or jackets. The tote gets high marks for looks, as its tailored style and colorful material definitely turned heads—don’t be surprised if you get asked many, many times where you found the bag when you’re carrying it around. We were also impressed with its capacity. You can fit up to 24 cans (there’s those four six-packs we mentioned) inside the bag, and while this does get as heavy as you’d think, the durable straps are supportive enough to distribute the weight more comfortably than a typical soft-sided cooler.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Neoprene exterior, vegan leather base</li><li>Dimensions: 21 inches x 7 inches x 14 inches</li><li>Care: Handwash only</li><li>Price: Currently $143.96, normally $179.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Durable</li><li>Stylish, unique design</li><li>Comes in four colors</li><li>Interior insulation is made from 100% recycled materials</li></ul><h3>best with a zipper: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Herschel Alexander Zip Tote</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/herschel.com/content/dam/herschel/products/11066/11066-02077-OS_01.jpg.sthumbnails.2000.2500.webp alt="Herschel Alexander Zip Tote" title="Herschel Alexander Zip Tote" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Herschel Alexander Zip Tote</h3></p><p>“Indestructible” is definitely a strong word, but having had a Herschel tote that’s made it through several years of beach trips with babies and well beyond without a scratch, it’s not totally inaccurate. This version is insulated, has three front pockets, and comes with a separate, insulated bottle sleeve. Its leak-proof interior is great for either lugging drinks to the beach, or wet towels and swimsuits home.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Recycled fabric (specifics not listed)</li><li>Dimensions: 22 inches x 7 inches x 15 inches</li><li>Care: Not listed</li><li>Price: $90</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comes in six colors</li><li>Main body is made of 100% recycled materials</li><li>Also available in smaller size</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>No internal pockets</li></ul><h3>Best for carrying capacity of 160 lbs: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Yiyi Guo F-color Mesh Beach Bag</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4aabcfcd-31a0-4d61-b05d-e693889d0924.258b8b9b3c6962871adcdc5df83d7219.png alt="Yiyi Guo F-color Mesh Beach Bag" title="Yiyi Guo F-color Mesh Beach Bag" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Yiyi Guo F-color Mesh Beach Bag</h3></p><p>A mesh bag doesn’t sound ideal for the beach, since it’s guaranteed you’re not keeping the sand out of it. But this tough, lightweight bag at least makes getting the sand out again easier, since the 3mm by 3mm holes in its mesh are large enough to allow sand to pass quickly through, rather than getting stuck in there for the rest of time. It also has nine—nine!—pockets (seven exterior mesh pockets, one large inside pocket, and one waterproof inside pocket) and a carrying capacity of 160 lbs. For something that somewhat resembles a goth’s body stocking, it’s surprisingly well suited to a day on the beach.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Ripstop mesh</li><li>Dimensions: 16.5 inches x 8.5 inches x 15 inches</li><li>Care: Not listed</li><li>Price: $19.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>So.

Being able to just rinse it off in the sink in less than 30 seconds. Made of sturdy, waterproof EVA, this is the Crocs of beach bags: The look isn’t to everyone’s taste, necessarily, but there’s no denying just how durable and easy it is. It’s also very hard to tip over, which is always a bonus on the beach.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)</li><li>Dimensions: 19 inches x 9.5 inches x 15 inches</li><li>Care: Just hose it down!</li><li>Price: $89.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comes in 35(!) solid colors, and nine patterned versions</li><li>Includes two clear, snap-on insert bags</li><li>Also available in smaller size</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews describe it as being too heavy</li></ul><h3>Best Waterproof Bag: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Qogir Neoprene Multipurpose Beach Bag Tote</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IO+5hTPcL._SL500_.jpg alt="Qogir Neoprene Multipurpose Beach Bag Tote" title="Qogir Neoprene Multipurpose Beach Bag Tote" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Qogir Neoprene Multipurpose Beach Bag Tote</h3></p><p>When you’re looking for a waterproof bag, it’s tough to argue with one made from literal wetsuit material. This neoprene tote has two large, water-resistant, internal zip pockets, and snaps on each end so that when you fold it up after use, it actually stays folded. It also smells like a surfer, and what’s not to like about that?</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Neoprene body, sailing rope handles</li><li>Dimensions: 14 inches x 10 inches x 12.5 inches</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: Currently $48.69, normally $81.15</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comes in over 20 colors and patterns</li><li>Removable shoulder pad and bottom board</li><li>Roomy</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Multiple reviews mention it has a strong scent when new, but as with most neoprene products, this will fade quickly</li></ul><h3>THE BIGGEST BAG, PERIOD: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Scout 4 Boys Bag Extra-Large Tote</a></h3><p>If you don’t have children, you’re probably looking at this and thinking, “Why on Earth would I ever need a bag the size of a Volkswagen?” If you do have children, though, you get it. Able to hold up to 75 lbs and featuring a stable, burst-proof bottom, this bag is as durable as it is enormous. A U-shaped zipper on top makes it easier to close—just don’t lose your child in there.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: All-weather woven fabric</li><li>Dimensions: 24 inches x 12 inches x 19 inches</li><li>Care: Wipe clean with damp towel (soap optional), air or towel dry</li><li>Price: $65</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Strong</li><li>Roomy</li><li>Lightweight (before you fill it, at least)</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Can hold so much stuff, you may need two people to carry it</li></ul><h3>Best for Solo Trip: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Baggu Cloud Bag</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0851/3262/products/49990f1dda7805bcdc40b3f5193512fdd1520575-2048x2560_1920x2363.jpg alt="Baggu Cloud Bag" title="Baggu Cloud Bag" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Baggu Cloud Bag</h3></p><p>First off, just because it’s called the Cloud Bag, it doesn’t mean you have to get the cloud print—here are three other color options to choose from. Whichever you choose, the bag is lightweight, but still large enough to hold enough for a solo trip to the beach (depending on what you have planned, of course—don’t get mad at us because it turned out you couldn’t fit a jet ski in there).</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Recycled nylon</li><li>Dimensions: 21 inches x 8 inches x 14 inches</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $56</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Folds up into its own detachable interior pouch</li><li>Both bag and packaging are made of recycled materials</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Not as many features as many of the other bags on this list</li></ul><h3>Best Anti Theft Beach Bag: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Vaultz Locking Cooler Bag</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.quill.com/is/image/Quill/m004075894_s7?$img400$ alt="Vaultz Locking Cooler Bag" title="Vaultz Locking Cooler Bag" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Vaultz Locking Cooler Bag</h3></p><p>Aside from being impaled by a runaway beach umbrella, nothing will ruin your day like seeing some no-good, thieving (insert bad word of your choice) has rifled through your belongings. Stop it happening with a secure bag: This waterproof tote has a built-in combination lock and tethering cable, meaning that not only can other people not open it, they can’t run off with it, either. As an added bonus, it’s insulated, so you can keep your sandwiches fresh alongside your valuables.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Nylon</li><li>Dimensions: 14 inches x 7.5 inches x 15 inches</li><li>Care: Not listed</li><li>Price: $58.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Water-resistant material and zipper</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only comes in two colors</li></ul><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-beach-bags>How we selected the best beach bags</h2><p>We made our choices through a combination of thorough research, positive customer reviews, and the personal experience of having spent several years living by the beach with young kids.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-in-a-beach-bag>What to consider in a beach bag</h2><p>The ideal beach bag is deceptively roomy, insulated, waterproof, easy to clean, and with multiple sealable pockets. Not every beach trip will require this—sometimes, a simple canvas tote will suffice—but for anyone planning on spending more than a couple of hours on the sand, you want to be able to fit in everything you need for the day, and ideally be able to keep the contents cold.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What should you pack in a beach bag?</h3><p>This depends entirely on what sort of day you’re expecting to have. Is it just you, planning on spending a leisurely hour or two relaxing by the ocean? Then grab your towel, sunscreen, sunglasses, a couple beverages of your choice, a good book, and off you go. Making a day of it with a friend or partner? Add snacks, more drinks, maybe a picnic lunch, possibly a small, waterproof bluetooth speaker (but please, please don’t blast your music: I’m sorry to break it to you if you’re the person who drags an industrial sound system to the beach every year, everybody hates you. Everybody.)</p><p>If you’re planning on spending the day at the beach with young kids, well, firstl, good luck. Second, pack everything you normally would for a day out and then add about 25% more stuff on top of it. One of my kids wants to be in the water constantly, even when it’s freezing and we’ve both turned blue, so we always bring something super warm and fluffy to bundle them up in afterwards. My other kid, meanwhile, is never happier than when grazing on the beach, so we pack at least three times as many snacks as we think we’ll need. Don’t forget to also grab their beach toys, hats, water bottles, and if you’re going with pre-toilet trained kids, bring enough diapers and wipes for an entire preschool (plus a sealable bag to put them in).</p><h3>What materials are the most durable and suitable for beach bags?</h3><p>Anything lightweight, waterproof, and easy to clean will be good. Waterproof nylon, canvas or polyester are good options, as is neoprene, although the latter tends to have a strong scent at first.</p><h3>How can I keep my beach bag organized and prevent sand from getting inside?</h3><p>Choosing a bag with sealable pockets is a good start—it’s the best way to make sure your phone, wallet, keys, etc, are both protected from the elements, and easy to grab without turning the whole bag upside down first. Beyond that, try to layer your stuff in the bag in order of when you’ll need it. Towel? On top. Change of clothes for when you head home at the end of the day? Stuff them all the way at the bottom, you won’t need those for hours.</p><h3>What are some innovative features or technologies found in modern beach bags?</h3><p>Waterproofing and added durability are big improvements to the simple bags of yesteryear, as is the creativity shown by some designers in adding pockets to almost every available surface. Sure, pockets aren’t exactly the most recent innovation, but they’re still a big consideration when picking a beach bag.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
