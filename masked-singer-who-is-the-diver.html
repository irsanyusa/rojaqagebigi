And with some initial clues in the first episode, we finally have some clues and voices to work off of. One of the performers taking the stage during the season premiere is the Diver.</strong></p><p>Fans online are already convinced of the Diver’s celebrity identity, but are they right? Let’s go through all the clues that led to that conclusion and make our big prediction.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Diver performs “Any Way You Want It” by Journey on The Masked Singer Season 10 Premiere</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>Prior to the season starting, we didn’t have any clues at all about the contestants on this season. But during the kickoff he said, “usually I’m pretty pumped, but lately I’ve been lost in the abyss. I may be the most hated creature in the ocean right now.” Then he showed his first clue, a cardinal, which we saw again in the premiere.</p><p>Also in those clues, the Diver started by holding up a newspaper that had “Extra! Extra!” printed on it. He mentioned that he’s “been everyone’s favorite person to hate.” We see a big hourglass in the shot. Later in his clues, they showed a compass pointing to “MW” (implying Midwest). We also saw a knight’s armor with golden lions on it.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>After the Diver’s first performance, we saw one final clue. It was a tabloid that said “Diver opens another business” and mentioned “11 million eyes.” The Diver explained that he wishes people would stay out of his business.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Diver</h2><p>The panelists predicted the Diver could be Adam Levine, Scott Disick, or Tom Sandoval. There’s a pretty big consensus on who this is online, based on his clue about being so hated right now. While some fans have guessed this could be Johnny Depp, most think it’s Tom Sandoval from Vanderpump Rules, who recently got caught in a scandal after he cheated on Ariana Madix.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Diver on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>We rarely make a prediction before a singer’s first performance and clues have aired, but with this one, we had to! That being said, we are confident that the Diver is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-sandoval>Tom Sandoval!</h3><p>While we only have a few clues and a few seconds of him singing, I mean come one. This is, unfortunately, him. He said “pump” in his first clue, he talked about being hated, AND the cardinal is a nod to his hometown of St. Louis, whose baseball team is the Cardinals.</p><p>Then, if you listen to his voice, the preview sounds exactly like his band, Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras. There’s even a video of them covering another Journey song on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Watch The Masked Singer Wednesdays on FOX to see if we’re right!
