Films in this category are pre-dominantly non-English and submitted by other film industries from all over the world.</p><p>Nigeria's film industry, Nollywood, isn't left out and has made a play for the award a number of times. However, the industry has been unlucky as none of its submissions have ever made it to the shortlist of five for Oscars night.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here's a list of all the films that have ever been submitted by the Nigerian Oscars Selection Committee (NOSC) for the Academy's consideration.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Lionheart - 2020</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6c089b4d-71d0-46a2-80bb-450112a9a5b8 data-caption="Genevieve Nnaji's Lionheart didn't meet the Oscars' eligibility requirements [Netflix]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/PY6ktkpTURBXy9lMTlhN2IxZDg3NTM5M2Y1MzBiNGFkZmE0NjA3ZGEwMC5qcGeSlQMAAM0DoM0CC5UCzQMWzQG-wsM></span><p><strong>Genevieve Nnaji</strong>'s family drama, <strong>Lionheart</strong>, made history in 2019 as the first Nigerian film submitted for the International Feature Film category for the 2020 Academy Awards. It was widely hailed as a turning point for Nollywood, finally ready to play on the big stage alongside other film industries from across the world.</p><p>However, The Academy disqualified the film because it failed the category's dialogue criteria to be "predominantly non-English," as only 11 minutes out of its 95-minute runtime was in the Igbo language. The disqualification was widely criticised, but failure to meet the requirement killed Lionheart's chances of making the shortlist. South Korean black comedy thriller, <strong>Parasite</strong>, eventually won the category.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>The Milkmaid - 2021</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-efc2d692-d1a7-4ad9-b507-94c4570e9fc1 data-caption="The Milkmaid film is predominantly in the Hausa language [DO]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/SN9ktkpTURBXy85MTdhMWYyOGQ5NDNkNDg3MmVmZTdkZGEwN2RhZjVjZC5qcGeSlQMAAM0KAM0FoJUCzQMWzQG9wsM></span><p>After the previous year's disappointment, the NOSC was more careful in its selection for the 2021 Oscars and submitted <strong>Desmond Ovbiagele</strong>'s <strong>The Milkmaid</strong> for the long list. The heart-wrenching film follows the survival of two sisters in a world of terrorists, with Hausa its predominant language.</p><p>However, <strong>The Milkmaid</strong> failed to make the Oscars shortlist, and the category was eventually won by <strong>Another Round</strong>, a submission by Denmark.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Mami Wata - 2024</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-104fa1c4-bfd9-4282-8c4a-79399312a047 data-caption="Mami Wata is the first Pidgin English film Nigeria submitted for the Oscars[The Sundance Institute]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Ow2ktkqTURBXy8xMDQzNmRjNDBiM2EyZmJjMDk0OWY0MmRmMGU1NTE4NS5qcGVnkpUDAADNCgDNBaCVAs0DFs0BvcLD></span><p>The NOSC failed to submit any films for the Oscars for 2022 and 2023, citing failure to meet qualification criteria as the main reason.</p><p>That changed in 2023 when the committee submitted <strong>CJ Obasi</strong>'s <strong>Mami Wata</strong>. The fantasy film made history as the first Nollywood film to screen at Sundance and even won a special jury prize for its striking cinematography.</p><p>Despite its critical acclaim and many other global accolades, the film also failed to be nominated for the Oscars shortlist and won't be in contention at tonight's ceremony.</p><p>The international films shortlisted for the category and expecting to win include <strong>Io Capitano</strong> (Italy), <strong>Perfect Days</strong> (Japan), <strong>Society of the Snow</strong> (Spain), <strong>The Teachers' Lounge</strong> (Germany), and <strong>The Zone of Interest</strong> (United Kingdom).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8sL%2FCmqmsZZGYrqWxzLJkmq%2BRp7G0ec2oo6Wxp6S8pXnFoqOmq12owqO5yK2rnpxfbMOyr8xyng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1558868-breckie-hills-age-height-birthday-net-worth-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Breckie Hills age, height, birthday, net worth, boyfriend</span></a>
