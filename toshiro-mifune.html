He spent his childhood in Dalian before serving in the Japanese Army Aviation division during World War II. After the war, he entered the film industry, beginning his acting career with a role in Shin Baka Jidai (1947), secured after impressing during an audition for Toho Studios.</p><p>From the 1950s through to the 1990s, Mifune's career flourished, particularly through his collaborations with Kurosawa. His nuanced portrayals made a significant impact on both Japanese and global audiences. He also featured in international projects such as the television miniseries Shogun (1980) and in historical roles.</p><p>Mifune faced challenges including financial difficulties due to the extended production of Red Beard (1965). This period also saw the strain and eventual rift in his relationship with Kurosawa. Nevertheless, Mifune persevered, carefully choosing his roles. He notably declined offers for roles in major films like You Only Live Twice and <a href=#>Star Wars</a>.</p><p>In his personal life, Mifune married Sachiko Yoshimine in 1950, and they had two sons together. He also fathered a daughter with actress Mika Kitagawa. As he aged, his health deteriorated, leading to his death in 1997.</p><p>Throughout his career, Mifune received many accolades for his work, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and the prestigious Japanese honor, the Order of the Sacred Treasure. His posthumous recognition includes a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>April 1</a>, <a href=#>1920</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Tsingtao, China</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Monkey</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>December 24</a>, <a href=#>1997</a> (aged 77)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Multiple organ failure</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Acting Career</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1950-08-25</a> "Rashomon", Japanese film directed by <a href=#>Akira Kurosawa</a>, starring Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyō, is released (Honorary Academy Award 1952)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1954-04-26</a> "Seven Samurai", Japanese film directed by <a href=#>Akira Kurosawa</a>, starring Toshiro Mifune, is released</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2016-11-14</a> Toshiro Mifune posthumously receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6912 Hollywood Boulevard</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwwM6sn6Kqn2K6qrLUp5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-lou-ferrigno-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Lou Ferrigno Make?
