He announced the news in a now-deleted Instagram post with pictures showing his undesirable physical state.</p><p>The photos he shared showed himself wearing a facemask and a beanie on a hospital bed surrounded by medical equipment. Apart from suffering from pneumonia, Cannon also lives with a rare form of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lupus</a> that specifically attacks his kidneys.</p><p>“I promised myself I would never be back at this place again. But this is a great lesson to take care of YOU or YOU won’t be able to take care of everyone else,” Cannon wrote.</p><p>Staying optimistic, the famous host is confident that he’ll make a full recovery after a brief stay in his small hospital room.</p><p>“It’s just pneumonia, nothing I can’t handle,” Cannon continued. “Don’t trip though, I don’t need any well wishes or prayers, just some solid rest, and I will be back on the journey to becoming stronger than ever.”</p><p>The comedian has learned a valuable lesson, “to take care of YOU or YOU won’t be able to take care of everyone else.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cannon’s Sold-Out Madison Square Garden Show</h2><p>The comedian recently performed in a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, as part the Wild ‘N Out Live tour.
