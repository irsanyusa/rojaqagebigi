Starting with the famous host’s first children with the best-selling female artist of all time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-moroccan-scott-cannon-monroe-cannon>Moroccan Scott Cannon, Monroe Cannon</h3><p>Moroccan Scott Cannon and Monroe Cannon are the fraternal twins Cannon shares with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariah Carey</a>. The twins were born in 2011 during Cannon and Carey’s eight-year-long marriage, the former couple still co-parents in 2022. Monroe is said to have been named after actress Marilyn Monroe, and Moroccan is a technological genius but a mischief maker.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Golden “Sagon” Cannon, Powerful Queen Cannon, Rise Messiah Cannon</h3><p>After the divorce with Carey, Cannon and model Brittany Bell welcomed their first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">child together</a> in February 21, 2017. Named Golden “Sagon” Cannon, the child would become the host’s happiness at the time of having career setbacks.</p><p>In December 2020, they had their second child together, daughter Powerful Queen Cannon. They recently welcomed their third baby together, Rise Messiah Cannon in September 2022.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Zion Mixolydian Cannon, Zillion Heir Cannon, Beautiful Zeppelin Cannon</h3><p>The host and comedian had his second set of twins, Zion Mixolydian Cannon and Zillion Heir Cannon, together with DJ Abby De La Rosa in July 2021.

The child marks the former AGT host’s eleventh child overall.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Zen Cannon</h3><p>Just nine days after Zillion and Zion were born, Cannon welcomed another son this time with model <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyssa Scott</a>. Zen Cannon was welcomed into the world on June 23, 2021, and was relatively quiet during the first couple of months.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zen was diagnosed with high-grade glioma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer in August. Baby Zen lost the battle with cancer in December 2021, he was just five months old.</p><p>The good news for Cannon is that he recently announced that he’s expecting another baby from the model. The unborn child would become Cannon’s twelfth child overall.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Onyx Ice Cole Cannon</h3><p>Cannon welcomed his daughter Onyx Ice Cole Cannon with LaNisha Cole.

Meditation and Rejuvenation aligns the Spirit!” Cannon wrote.</p><p>The host posted a sweet message for baby Onyx while showing a picture of the kid resting on top of him. Onyx was dedicated to the church by his parents saying that the child will put God as his center.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Legendary Love Cannon</h3><p>&nbsp;On July 2022, <a href=#>Legendary Love Cannon</a> was born through natural means. Cannon first announced that he was expecting a baby with model Bre Tiesi. The couple has been dating on and off for many years, but has since welcomed their first child only recently.
