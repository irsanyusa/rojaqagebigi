Today at&nbsp;Bright Side we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;our favorite Disney princesses to&nbsp;see how they should have really looked.
1. Pocahontas
Originally called Matoaka, which means “flower between 2&nbsp;streams,” Pocahontas was between the ages of&nbsp;10&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;during this story, not in&nbsp;her 20s as&nbsp;she appears in&nbsp;the Disney film."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Pocahontas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a8/ffb/743136572f91d882d506a9d579.jpg><p>Originally called <a href=#>Matoaka</a>, which means “flower between 2&nbsp;streams,” Pocahontas was between the ages of&nbsp;10&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;during this story, not in&nbsp;her 20s as&nbsp;she appears in&nbsp;the Disney film. Since she was the daughter of&nbsp;the Powhatan chief, she wore deer skin with beads hung around her neck and she had her hair braided.</p><p><h2>2. Princess Jasmine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/496/3f5/b7f6a557bbbcf189bab8c90179.jpg><p>Princess Jasmine was originally called <a href=#>Badroulbadour</a>. Word on&nbsp;the street is&nbsp;that her name was changed to&nbsp;make her more <a href=#>relatable</a>. She originally wore loose-fitting and modest clothing because of&nbsp;the hot environment she lived&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>3. Snow White</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33e/1a4/a412f85bcbb2ed76e408fc63dd.jpg><p>Snow White lived in&nbsp;16th century Germany during the <a href=#>Protestant</a> reformation period. Women then mostly wore dark-colored outfits with high necklines. They would also frequently wear a&nbsp;headpiece and have their hair tied back.</p><p><h2>4. Rapunzel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec0/e59/7b49ba517d8b40885d88d13f07.jpg><p>The setting for Rapunzel’s story was also during the mid-16th in&nbsp;<a href=#>Germany</a>. At&nbsp;that time women wore very ladylike clothing and according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;German painter, during that era the dresses were known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Cranachs</a> gowns.</p><p><h2>5. Aurora</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dab/77b/197ffd57e4b836d0c501918ec2.jpg><p>The story of&nbsp;Princess Aurora in&nbsp;Sleeping Beauty took place in&nbsp;14th century <a href=#>France</a>. Back then, noblewomen wore tailored dresses with tight-fitting sleeves and bodices. These outfits were usually buttoned down the front and were known as&nbsp;Cotehardie.</p><p><h2>6. Elsa</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/378/68c/38afb1581db2025ca3a8ec3852.jpg><p>Elsa lived in&nbsp;the mid-18th century and women then wore beautiful Victorian dresses with ballgown silhouettes. They had just started using corsets and embroidery was not very common. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;new queen, Elsa would’ve worn a&nbsp;more intricately designed cape, instead of&nbsp;the more simple one that she had on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the film.</p><p><h2>7. Ariel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a8/867/0d606f533583fec3eb279124e1.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;accurate depiction of&nbsp;underwater Ariel, since we&nbsp;have never seen a&nbsp;mermaid in&nbsp;real life, so&nbsp;let’s take her look from when she was turned into a&nbsp;human. During the 17th century, which was the setting of&nbsp;the story, women wore off-the-shoulder dresses and big poofy sleeves, which is&nbsp;most likely what should have been depicted in&nbsp;the film.</p><p><h2>8. Princess Mulan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ec/045/0cee6e5f179208c41bc3cb71a3.jpg><p>During the Northern Wei Dynasty, the ballad of&nbsp;the legendary Princess Mulan tells the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl who cut her hair short to&nbsp;disguise herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. But in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;her clothing during this era, women at&nbsp;this time were known to&nbsp;wear loose and layered clothing that was tight at&nbsp;the waist and had extremely wide sleeves. The makeup they used was also bright and fun and they wore flowers in&nbsp;their hair.</p><p><h2>9. Cinderella</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91c/e97/4b09345e7bb5303aa37678b43d.jpg><p>This story was first thought to&nbsp;have <a href=#>emerged</a> in&nbsp;the 18th Century, but it&nbsp;may have been inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;much older story, telling the tale of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman from China who lived around 206&nbsp;BCE. You should also know that during this time, there were not many portraits of&nbsp;women with blonde hair since it&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashionable data-link=tag>fashionable</a> hair color in&nbsp;the 1830s.</p><p><h2>10. Belle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a1/2db/1f614a5ba3af0a2249aa149091.jpg><p>Belle was one of&nbsp;the princesses that was animated more accurately than most of&nbsp;the other ones, but her depiction was still not “perfect.” Since the story was set in&nbsp;18th century France, Belle’s dresses should have been more fashionable. Besides the poufs that ladies wore at&nbsp;the time, they also had flowers, ribbons, lace, feathers, and jewelry.</p><p>Which Disney Princess was your favorite growing&nbsp;up?
