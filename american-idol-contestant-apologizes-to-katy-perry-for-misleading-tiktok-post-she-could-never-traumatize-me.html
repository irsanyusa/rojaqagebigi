According to him, his statements were supposed to be funny, but the internet took it too seriously.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adriel Carrion Claims that Katy Perry Humiliated Him Amid American Idol Audition</h2><p>Earlier this month, Carrion created a TikTok video to open up about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol </a>season 19 experience. The former contestant particularly reflected on his audition, where the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Roar” hitmaker</a> almost rejected their “Watermelon Sugar” performance.</p><p>In the upload, Carrion inserted a video showing how he and another contestant, Anthony Guzman, were about to sing Harry Style’s 2019 music smash. At the time, Perry was apparently so done with “Watermelon Sugar” performances that she snapped over the duo’s song choice.</p><p>“Not ‘Watermelon Sugar’ … I can’t take another ‘Watermelon Sugar’!” she said.</p><p>The resurfaced clip also exhibited how Carrion’s face turned from smiley to disappointed. Recounting this moment, the former contestant stated that Perry appears in his nightmares until today.</p><p>“I can be getting my beauty rest and all I hear in my nightmares ‘Not ‘Watermelon Sugar,'” he said.</p><p>Apparently, while Carrion did not intend to malign Perry in the TikTok video, news came off the internet a bit differently. Current headlines imply that the “Firework” singer has badly inflicted trauma on the former contestant.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-the-tiktok-video-was-meant-to-be-funny>He Says the TikTok Video was Meant to be Funny</h2><p>Shocked by how his TikTok upload was taken by the web, Carrion made another video to address the situation. Evidently, the former contestant did not expect that his content will make it to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">legitimate news websites</a>. The former contestant then clarified that he was intentionally “making fun” of their audition video.</p><p>“To this day I am blasting California Girls, tails flapping in the wind!” he said. “She could never traumatize me.”</p><p>Some users in the comments agreed in favor of Carrion, saying that other people are unbelievably “reaching.” Additionally, the former contestant replied in one comment, saying that news websites are too “bored.”</p><p>“So if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry</a> ever sees any of this, I am sorry for the miscommunication of the interwebs,” he said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the clip, Carrion pointed out that he wasn’t the one who chose “Watermelon Sugar” as their audition song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=3><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@adriel_carrion/video/7204551482388073771?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7017400431463728641</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_CourtneyHadwin_viaFacebook-220x147.jpeg alt="Courtney Hadwin is Bold, Vulnerable in Debut Single ‘Breakable’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2abn6PBpr%2FTmqWtZZGlvK27xqKxnqtdqbxut8CtsGaolae%2FunnFqKlmpZmouaatw6KloGWknri1u8pmp6irpGLAqbGMnKaupJRiu6bCxKtkraqRqrqiwMiznGallWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./service-national-universal-un-decret-va-officialiser-la-creation-du-sejour-de-cohesion.html><span>←</span><span>un dcret officialise la cration du &amp;quot;sjour de cohsion&amp;quot;</span></a>
