Here’s what we know about him:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. He’s the fourth Japanese scientist to have won a Nobel Prize for medicine<br></strong>Ohsumi is the 25th Japanese person to win a Nobel Prize, and the fourth to win the medicine prize, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Japan Times</a>. Born in 1945 in Fukuoka, Japan, he spent three years at Rockefeller University in New York before returning to the University of Tokyo (where he previously received a PhD) to establish his research group.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He is currently a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. He’s the first scientist to define cell recycling<br></strong>Cells need to recycle in order to survive. “When nutrients are scarce, the cell has a system for breaking down old or unneeded machinery and harvesting the parts to keep itself going,” explains Ivan Semeniuk of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Globe and Mail</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This crucial, ‘self-eating’ system, known as autophagy, was detected by Ohsumi in baker’s yeast cells in 1988. He has since <a href=# rel=noopener>referred to himself</a> as “a basic researcher in yeast” – even though his discovery is widely recognized as fundamental to human cell survival.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. His focus of research could help explain a number of diseases<br></strong>As cancer or neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s can form when there are mutations in autopaghy genes, studying this recycling system can help explain – and prevent – the occurrence of many diseases.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speaking to the Globe and Mail after receiving the 2015 Gairdner International Award, Canada’s top international medical-science prizes, Ohsumi said he believed his discovery’s “relevance to many diseases will be discovered in the near future”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4. It also explains how we can adapt to starvation<br></strong>Autophagy is a natural defence our bodies use to survive – and exploring it can help scientists understand how we manage to cope with extreme situations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Ohsumi’s discoveries opened the path to understanding the fundamental importance of autophagy in many physiological processes, such as in the adaptation to starvation or response to infection,” said the Nobel Assembly in a <a href=# rel=noopener>press release</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5. He had a message for young scientists<br></strong>Ohsumi was surprised about winning the prize, but “extremely honored”, the Associated Press reported Monday, following the announcement. “All I can say is, it’s such an honor,” he told reporters at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, according to the Japanese broadcaster NHK and <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>. “I’d like to tell young people that not all can be successful in science, but it’s important to rise to the challenge.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbWFrgHV9jrKmrKCZo7yztYyon6ytnZ56r7vBnqNmqKKex6Z51qKlp52iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./le-credit-demploi-elargi-lensemble-des-services.html><span>←</span><span>Le crdit d'emploi largi l'ensemble des services</span></a>
